                "body": "<p>It is not true that your oven is at 400 degrees, that's a convenient fiction which is easy to put on a dial.</p>\n<p>In fact, an oven has two heating elements, which are pumping energy into the inside of the oven. The oven dial just determines the energy that will be emitted, averaged over a longish period of time. The energy is transferred to the oven walls, the air in the oven, the food, and the pan material.</p>\n<p>Out of those, the food is the worst heat sink you have. The air has almost no mass, and is heated quickly. The metal conducts heat well, heats up quickly, and starts emitting itself once heated. The organic matter in your food is slow to heat up, especially by conduction from the warm air. Direct radiation from the heat element contributes a lot, especially to surface browning. And of course, for the conduction to happen, you need the air layer close to the food to be warm, not a wad of cooled down air which just exchanged its energy with the food.</p>\n<p>As soon as you fill your oven up, these effects are disturbed. For conduction, you get the same amount of energy, but it has to be exchanged with a much higher mass, so you get less energy per unit of food. For convection, Ecnerwal already explained that the foods block the flow of air, so the air surrounding the food is colder than it would have been. And for radiation, the upper crust of the uppermost food absorbs everything coming from the upper element, and the lower crust of the lowermost food absorbs from below.</p>\n<p>The oven is not a completely dumb device, it does have a sensor, and so it should keep the heating elements turned on for longer in such a situation than in an emptier oven. But first, as Ecnerwal pointed out, the sensor has an arbitrary position that is not so close to the food, and you have created a situation in which the heat distribution within the oven is very unequal. And second, I would guess that, even if it goes on for longer, it is just not sufficient to cook your food quicker. This is especially true with modern baking techniques, where we use light ovens and barely preheat them, so that they are nowhere close to thermal equilibrium when we add our food. This is a really good thing for both our wallets and the environment, but it does require you to get used to cooking times that vary with oven loading.</p>\n",

For example, if you are frying fish, and you take out pieces that are done and add raw fish to the hot fish, the temperature will drop your grease and the best way to fix this is to place a lid on your pan to increase the temperature back up.\nHope this helps.</p>\n<p>Felicia</p>\n",

For the first 15 minutes, everything's fine. Then, I see liquid forming at the top of the stone. Soon enough, tons of smoke is coming out and I have to turn on the fan. I decided to abandon my plan to create the perfect pizza because of this problem with my stone.</p>\n<p>I think the liquid coming out of the pizza stone is oil that's been absorbed from past times I've cooked with it. It wasn't a problem then because I didn't preheat my pizza stone previously and only cooked at 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C.

But as you didn't preheat the stone when you used it at this low temperature, it probably never even got that hot (BTW you sound like you've learnt this by now, but if you're not going to preheat it, there's no point using a stone).</p>\n<p>So you should probably start by putting it in a cold oven and turning on to 425\u00b0F. When that temperature has been reached and held for a good few minutes, and it's not smoking, increase by 25\u00b0 and wait until it stops smoking. Keep going until you reach the maximum on the dial.</p>\n<p>You can do all this on a day when you can ventilate well, not just before use. Alternatively it's not unknown to use pizza stones in barbecues, so you could try and burn it off outside, but without the temperature control.</p>\n<p>If there's any chance that water could have soaked in, from even a brief dip or a wipe with a dripping wet cloth, start with a couple of hours not far below boiling point (say 80\u00b0C or 200\u00b0F) to dry it.</p>\n<p>New stones are supposed to be baked with nothing on top before first use anyway.

I think the length of time roasting makes a big difference and the chicken comes out delicious with crispy skin every time.  ( This is for chicken thighs and legs on the bone. For chicken breast on the bone, I would reduce the cooking time by half hour at least) If you are still not obtaining the desired results, I would increase the temp and lower the cooking time. The large cloud of steam is from the water and I believe you are correct - the chicken will not become crispy with all of that humidity. Good luck!</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Not a full answer, but some steps to troubleshoot/may help:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Hang a manual oven thermometer in as close as possible to the place as you would normally put your food. Make sure you read it through the window without opening the oven. You may have to move your racks so that you can get the thermometer to the same height as you food would be at. Do a dry run of cooking your most basic recipe--preheat, open and close the oven exactly as you would normally, etc., just without food and keep notes of what the thermometer says (start, end, and maybe 4-6 times evenly spaced through the process). Let your oven cool completely, then same process again, but with convection mode on. If you have a friend or relative who will let you repeat the process in their oven, do that, too. (Manual thermometers are extremely cheap, so you can also get several and hang them in different places.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Buy a box cake mix (yes, yes) and prepare it exactly as specified on the box, cook at exactly the time and temperature specified, etc. Weigh it before and after cooking to calculate moisture loss. Take notes about the doneness in various spots: edge, one third of the way in from the edge, center, top, and bottom. Report back here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Try putting your food in a Dutch oven inside the oven, turn convection mode on. If you don't have a Dutch oven, you can put your normal dish on a cookie sheet with an oven safe bowl covering it, or you can use foil (but make sure the foil is fully encasing your food and <em>secured</em> so it doesn't get blown around). (It might be worthwhile to sacrifice another box cake mix here just for consistency, so you can compare the same doneness points as from step 2.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thoughts: Convection oven is basically the same as a normal oven+fan, but of course there are options even with normal ovens.</p>\n<p>Normal ovens usually have a significant temperature gradient from top to bottom (hotter at the top), the fan on a convection oven distrutes the heat more evenly. If the power is the same, with the fan on it will be--compared to fan off--cooler at the top and hotter at the bottom. Since most people tend to cook closer to the middle or bottom, for most people the convection mode will be hotter (at the same power) than conventional. However, some convection ovens try to adjust the power for you based on mode, so the power might be different for the same temperature setting depending on if the fan is on or not. (This might also be a place where things can go wrong.)</p>\n<p>The exact shape of the interior and the arrangement of the heating elements/burner can also cause hot or cold spots in an oven...you only really care about the spot your food sits at.</p>\n<p>Some ovens also have options re: which heating elements are on (top, bottom, both). Convection ovens may have fan speed, etc., options, too. It may be worthwhile to cuddle up with the manual and list out all of the options which your oven has, then try each one from a cold oven with the temperature set the same and thermometer in the same place, note temperature as intervals that make sense for the types of recipes that you normally cook. (It can also be helpful to do this for the minimum and maximum temperatures which your oven supports, so that you know the full range actually available.)</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>This depends very strongly on what kind of oven you have.  Since there are many, many variations in oven design, I'm going to go over three contrary options based on my own personal experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Gas oven, freestanding and thinly insulated</strong>: with an oven like this, you can turn the heat down to a lower temperature, put the new food in, and expect that the new food won't cook a lot differently than it would if you allowed 10-15minutes for the oven to cool.  Gas ovens depend heavily on hot air convection from the gas flames to transfer heat to the food, and when you turn down the temperature, if the oven is not well-insulated, the temperature will fall almost as quickly as the food heats up.  The only food I wouldn't do this with would be something which was <em>very</em> sensitive to rapid overcooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Electric oven, built-in and well-insulated</strong>: my current electric oven, on the other hand, is very well insulated and relies on radiant heat from the walls of the oven to cook foods.  As such, if I turn it down from 450F to 250F, I can expect that foods inside the oven will still be exposed to heat higher than 300F for at least 1/2 hour.  As such, if I need to drop the oven temperature for cooking reasons, I prop the oven door open.</p>\n<p><strong>High-end electric oven with exhaust fan</strong>: I've also had the chance to cook in higher quality ovens that contain an internal exhaust fan with an exhaust pipe to the outside.  These ovens actively cool themselves off when you lower the temperature, so going from 450F to 250F would take less than 10 minutes, despite the thick insulation.  With this oven, you just turn the heat down and put the food in.</p>\n",

But still, you can expect (or hope) that the heat saved in your well-preheated oven is significant, and that &quot;the amount of heat the oven continues to add to maintain the temperature&quot; is the negligible one.

                "body": "<p>Neither research nor experimentation led me to a combination of button presses that resolved the issue, nor did I discover what the manual meant by the word &quot;reprogram&quot;.  I did resolve the issue, however.</p>\n<p>Other online sources suggested <em>resetting</em> the oven by unplugging it for a time.  I had tried this already, but I had left the power disconnected for only about 30 seconds.  That was not effective for me, but some sources suggested leaving the oven unpowered for ten minutes or more to effect a reset.</p>\n<p>I actually left the oven unpowered for several hours, which I'm sure was overkill.  Additionally, though I'm uncertain whether it was necessary, we held down the door sensor switch while we restored power, on the theory that we would prevent the oven from recognizing the door open / latch closed fault condition.  When power was restored, the door latch started rotating. We held the sensor switch until the latch stopped (in the unlatched position).  That seems to have fully resolved the issue.</p>\n",

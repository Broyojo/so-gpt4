        <h1>Comparison of Answer Quality in Stack Overflow</h1>
        <h2>Research Consent Form</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for considering participation in our research study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
            quality of answers provided to questions on Stack Overflow, an online technical forum. Your participation
            will involve comparing two different answers to the same question and selecting the one you think is best.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before agreeing to participate, please read the following information carefully. Participation in this study
            is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without penalty.
        </p>
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>
            If you agree to participate in this study, you will first be asked to select the programming languages you
            are most proficient in. Based on your selection, you will be presented with a series of questions from Stack
            Overflow, each followed by two potential answers. Your task is to read the questions and answers carefully
            and select the one you believe to be the best answer. There are no right or wrong answers; we are simply
            interested in your opinion. If you encounter a question you do not know how to answer, you may skip it.
        </p>

            Please ensure that cookies are enabled in your browser. This will allow us to identify if you choose to fill
            out the survey more than once, ensuring that your responses are not treated as those from a new user.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study is expected to take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Your participation is completely
            voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without penalty.
        </p>
        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            All data collected during this study will be kept confidential. We will not collect any personally
            identifiable information (such as names, email addresses, or age). Your responses will be anonymized, and
            any identifying information will be removed. The anonymized data may be used in future research or
            publications, but your identity will never be disclosed.
        </p>

Gin and other liquors are actually mostly water, or at least a significant percentage will be water. Typically gin is somewhere around 60% water and 40% alcohol, any flavorings are trace elements.</p>\n<p>Prunes are dried so they aren't going to contribute moisture to the gin, they will absorb both water and alcohol from the liquor. The question is whether the prunes will absorb more alcohol or more water, or both equally. I have no scientific basis to answer that, so I'll apply some rough numbers to show what the possibilities are.</p>\n<p>Say alcohol is absorbed 30% more than water in the fruit, which is a guess but about the maximum difference I'd expect either way. If you have 500ml of gin which is 40% alcohol (80 proof) and the fruit soaks up 100ml of gin then it will absorb about 10ml more alcohol than if it was absorbed evenly. This would reduce the alcohol percentage by around 2.5% of the total volume of the liquor. The opposite works, if the fruit absorbs 30% more water than alcohol the alcohol level would go up 2.5%. These are rough figures, the true figure is dependent on the fruit itself, ratio of fruit to alcohol, alcohol percentage in the liquor, and other factors.</p>\n",

Both are cut into 2-4&quot; strips, bone-in or no bone.<br>\nIn recent times the pork shoulder we have been using has been hard to find and expensive. The pork ribs have been plentiful and much lower cost.<br>\nWe cut these into 1&quot; squares to use in stew dishes. Is there any significant differences in how these will come out in stews?<br>\nOr maybe it's just a naming convention to confuse people?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: These are regular oven baked stews, maybe 1 hour, not slow cooking. Either pork and vegetables in broth, or in barbecue sauce.<br>\nMy main concern is whether there would be any significant difference in texture or taste, fat content, or how well the cubes hold together.</p>\n",

Over time, your starter will conform to your environment.  In fact, this is an interesting element of starters.  As different environments can create different flavors.  I would suggest a larger container, or a smaller amount of starter until things stabilize, and you come to understand how your starter performs.  You can easily adjust the quantity.  It's all proportional.  I keep a very small amount of already established starter alive and in the refrigerator, like maybe 1/4 cup.  Then, when I want to bake, I remove it from the fridge, and take a couple of days to scale things up to the amount I want to use.</p>\n",

When you use flour in gravy, gluten formation is unwanted. (That's one of the reasons you cook the flour before adding the liquid: it prevents gluten from forming.) The important textural aspect of the wheat flour is the starch, which thickens the gravy.</p>\n<p>There are other sources of starch which can thicken liquids like gravy. Cornstarch and arrowroot starch are the most common in American cuisine. You can use xanthan gum to thicken liquids, but the result has an extremely slimy consistency, particularly if dairy is also used. Trust me on this: you will not want to eat a gravy which is thickened with cream and xanthan gum.</p>\n<p>Cornstarch is a slightly more powerful thickener than wheat flour, so I would use about 70% as much. It does not need to be cooked in a roux; thoroughly mix it with a bit of cold water and then pour it into the gravy while mixing rapidly. The appropriate amount of xanthan gum in this case is 0%.</p>\n",

If you are measuring water, which has a very consistent density, then you can convert easily. If you are measuring walnuts, which could be packed tightly or loosely, then the conversion will have to be very rough. Flour is somewhere in between which is why there are different measurements.</p>\n<p>This is why most regular or professional bakers use weights rather than volume measurements, although I understand that in some parts of the world volume measurements are still typical. If you trust the recipe writer, then <strong>a recipe written using volume measurements should not require perfect precision anyway so I would just go for a weight somewhere in the middle of the estimates you have found</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the recipe is in a cookbook you may even have a section at the start/end giving conversions, or giving instructions for how to measure the volume (for example by tapping the cup to allow the flour to settle).</p>\n",

In a way, all of them are.</p>\n<p>The weight equivalent of volumetric measurements will depend on the packing, which in turn will depend on the baker.</p>\n<p>The probably lowest value you will get if you use slightly older flour, stored in a dry environment, sieved, then spooned into the measuring cup and leveled. That\u2019ll be pretty close to, I\u2019d say 110 g. In contrast, a flour from a humid environment, that has settled during transport and storage and was then scooped directly with the measuring cup - you can get easily close to 150g in that case.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the latter isn\u2019t good practice, but it shows the difference and the Achilles heel of measuring by volume. When a recipe requires precision and reliability, it\u2019s usually written in weight-based measurements and ratios. In daily use, many recipes have enough tolerance built in for the kind of errors introduced by volumetric units, and some will explain the method (e.g. \u201cspooned and leveled\u201d). In baking there\u2019s often a final step that says add \u201c1-3 tablespoons of milk\u201d or \u201cas needed\u201d - aiming to get the batter to the desired consistency.</p>\n<p>If you need true precision, use a scale. There are e.g. macaron recipes that start with weighing the eggs, then weigh the other ingredients based on that. Likewise commercial recipes that will list \u201c350g egg\u201d instead of seven eggs - which is roughly the same amount, but not necessarily exactly the same.</p>\n",

When the pork cooks the juices collect into the water below in order to make a gravy afterwards, but the skin isn't always as crisp as I hoped.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>My method for roasted chicken with crispy skin on the outside and moist, tender flesh on the inside is to sprinkle desired spices on top of the skin with a bit of cooking spray and roast for 1.5-2 hours at 375 F (190-200C) uncovered. I think the length of time roasting makes a big difference and the chicken comes out delicious with crispy skin every time.  ( This is for chicken thighs and legs on the bone. For chicken breast on the bone, I would reduce the cooking time by half hour at least) If you are still not obtaining the desired results, I would increase the temp and lower the cooking time. The large cloud of steam is from the water and I believe you are correct - the chicken will not become crispy with all of that humidity. Good luck!</p>\n",

If you are frying a steak, you will have lots of droplets and aerosol. If you are frying food which has been frozen (and is now leaking more moisture), you will have more droplets than if you are frying fresh food.</p>\n<p>There are two things that will help to some extent, but not drastically reduce the spatter. One is to not throw frozen food into the pan, always room temperature. And the second is to always use dry food - if you are not layering anything on, pat it dry with a paper towel. If you are using layers, always end with a dry layer such as breadcrumbs or flour.</p>\n<p>Since the micro-explosions happen in the water/steam phase (the oil is just being flung around as a kind of explosion debris), I doubt that changing something about the cooking oil will change the droplet generation. Changing the temperature inside the frying pan may have an effect, but it will also drastically reduce the quality of your food.</p>\n<p>The phenomenon of oil smoking is unrelated to this kind of greasy aerosol generation. The expanding steam will fling around anything in which it is suspended, no matter if it is burnt oil or unburnt oil.</p>\n<p>The only thing you can do about your choice of frying fat is to choose a pure fat - that is, anything beside butter or margarine. If you choose an emulsion of water in oil, you will get more splattering. But all oils, ghee, and animal fats such as rendered lard should give you equal splatter amount.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Fat, collagen or connective tissue, and cooking time and temp, all have an impact on tenderness.  Steaks with uniform fat marbling are graded higher because, not only does fat add flavor, but when it breaks down it makes the steak more tender.  Collagen begins to melt and dissolve to gelatin between 160F and 180F (71C and 82C). Oxtail (in your example) has much more fat and collagen than your steak.  When the fat and collagen break down, you get tender and moist meat.  Since steak has some fat, but much less collagen, it will overcook, the fat will melt out, and you will be left with an overcooked and dry product. Of course well-cooked steak can be tender (though, depending on the cut, some more tender than others)...and poorly cooked oxtail can be tough, so applying proper cooking technique to the particular cut of meat to maximize tenderness is critical. If you want maximum tenderness, find a high fat, high collagen cut, and cook it with moist consistent heat until the collagen melts out....short rib, or pot roast come to mind as examples, along with your oxtail.</p>\n",

Maybe also let the mixture stand a little while longer before pouring it into your moulds.

The vacuum is collapsing the cell structure.  Often times, flavoring is added, and the vacuum serves to push that flavor into the product.

I went to the shop and bought tall, narrow steel cup. I decided to hold it directly above smallest fire my stove can produce and sticking hand mixer into my yolks. They lost deep orange color due to incorporating air, however they quickly became more and more solid up to the point i was satisfied with consistency. I'm sure double boiler with hand whisking would also work, but this is just less messy and faster. Salt, pepper and MSG with lemon juice to balance helped to achieve perfect runny yolky taste. It doesn't behave quite like mayo, however its solid enough to not fall off the burger on every occasion, I was little scared of going further than 2-3 mins, but I'm happy with the results. Thanks!</p>\n",

Usually when I need to substitute for garlic or onion, I use a tiny amount of asafoetida, which works well enough for that strong alium taste. However, that's not the role of the onion in this stew, and I'm a little stumped for how to substitute it out.</p>\n<p>For starters, this stew only has three ingredients: lamb stew meat, onion, and water (plus a host of spices). It simmers for about 2-3 hours, during which point the onion dissolves completely and the tough meat becomes tender. (It's then served over rice; not important to the narrative.)</p>\n<p>The onion serves to add a touch of sweetness, which mellows out the lamb meat. It also provides a slight thickness to the liquid. I tried omitting the onion entirely, and the end result was nearly harsh -- it's definitely something I want to try and substitute out instead of simply omit.</p>\n<p>Asafoetida is a decent substitute for the garlicy/oniony taste, but that's not really the primary characteristic I'm going for here -- I'm looking for that mild sweetness that shows up after you cook onions low and slow until they dissolve into nothing. For thickness, I figure I can blend in minute quantities of corn starch until I reach the desired consistency -- but I can't figure out what to use for the sweetness.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n",

After a get-together when the kitchen looks frighteningly hard to clean, can one ever leave a cast iron pan for cleaning seven or so days later?

I can continue experimenting of course, but I'd rather hear expert opinion to reduce the number of these experiments.</p>\n<p><strong>Detail</strong></p>\n<p>If you do have a gummied cast iron pan, the only real solution is to leave it in the oven for one hour at 450-500F.

A trivet would work, or simply shift to a burner that has not been used. Both of these options will help to prevent the remaining oil from beginning to polymerise before you've cleaned any food residue out.</p>\n<p>Source: I'm terrible and regularly don't clean/re-season my cast iron for weeks at a time.

                "body": "<p>Cast iron should be cleaned \u2018promptly\u2019 because that is when it is the easiest to clean\u2026 while the pan is still hot. For the sake of your question, let\u2019s assume that you are talking about an already seasoned cast iron frying pan. When you clean it immediately after you use it (or at least while it is still warm), you can just take it to the sink &amp; brush all the food off with hot water (the hotter the better) until it is smooth &amp; free of food particles. To scrub the food particles off, use something like a bamboo brush, corn husk brush, luffa, etc. that will not melt in a hot pan. Do not use dish soap inside your pan. If the outside &amp;/or handle of your pan is greasy, it is okay to use dish soap on it to get the greasiness off the outside.</p>\n<p>If your pan has gotten cold (whether it has been a few hours or a few days), all you need to do is to put enough water to cover the bottom of the pan including any remaining burnt on food and then bring your pan to a full rolling boil. Boil long enough for any burnt on food to loosen (use a flat edged utensil to scrape the bottom of the pan if necessary). Then wash it as if you just finished cooking, under the sink with the hottest water that will come out of your faucet (you might have to wait for your faucet water to get hot before bringing your pan to the sink to clean). You can also use the boiling water method immediately after you cooked something if there is a lot of food stuck on the bottom of the pan. Never leave water in your pan to soak and then come back later! Only use water to soak if you are in the process of cleaning your pan. Additionally, you can dry the pan on a stove burner and heat thoroughly until totally dry, let cool and then put away.  Do this if you have any question that you may not have cleaned the pan as good as you think you should have (kind of like sterilizing your pan). There should be no greasy residue left on the pan.</p>\n<p>If your pan is gummy, you are not cleaning your pan well enough after each use to get the grease off. Many people believe that you are supposed to coat your pan with oil after each use but this is not good for your pan. The oils will build up and can even go rancid on your pan. Lodge told you to put your pan in the oven at 500 degrees for a length of time because that is the only way to burn off the gummy oils that are stuck to your pan. However, you normally should not ever have to do this with a properly maintained pan. I have had a few pans fail on me &amp; sometimes I buy some cast iron pans at a yard sale really cheap b/c they are all gummied. I save them and take them camping with me &amp; throw them on an open fire directly on the wood coals and it burns off all the built on gummy oils and returns the pan back to raw. However, then you will need to start over and re-season your pan.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>So, based upon the Hannah Glasse recipe that <code>steb</code> found, it rather looks like the &quot;old tymey&quot; way of making Yorkshire Pudding was never the &quot;old tymey&quot; way of making Yorkshire pudding.</p>\n<p>Modern way:  Hot oven (probably hotter than the position in the fireplace picked by HG on a given day), sealed, basically (certainly compared to a fireplace without even lids to the vessels used) allowing heat to be constant above and below, as well as allowing humidity to build to a higher level, heated oil to begin with, the watery &quot;batter&quot; (compared to a less watery by far &quot;dough&quot;), and a cooking time that waits on the cooking of the batter into a bread-y result. At some point around here, one takes them out and eventually makes use of them, as such pretty much, with some (modern) gravy and meat, usually on them, but conceivably as dipping materials or put-them-together-and-get-the-fork-to-your-mouth kind of arrangement.</p>\n<p>Alternate result:  end up with popovers.</p>\n<p>HG's recipe differs in a couple respects. The humidity will NEVER build up the way it can in a modern, pretty sealed, oven. So the rising will be much less. Why? There are no rising agents AT ALL in either recipe, none. The only thing to make the bread expand during cooking is the moisture in the batter. At the moment, think ball of choco-chip cookie dough but runnier so already flattened out, largely. What forces them into the unusual shapes? The exceedingly hot oil the batter is placed upon begins making a bottom crust immediately, and heats the rest. That rest expands every direction, but the underneath is already crusting so wherever it expands there will be a tendency to honor that crusting, so to speak, limiting it from running everywhere. A little more here, a little less there, the batter above the slightly hardening crust underneath it expanding up and about as it all happens... we get the unique shaping of puddings even in the same pan. But it has to have immediate heating to the batter, not just the crust so as to start evaporation and maybe even some micro-boiling, to push the upper layer of it all up. Since it can spread it doesn't have to end up straight up like a popover, but more, with the outer top hardening as well, slowly, outward becomes prevalent, not &quot;runaway&quot; but prevalent. That is accentuated in the fireplace cooking as the crusting above is not fought by a rising humidity carrying some moisture the top crust softening it and letting the rise be straight up. The hardest part of the top? The original top of the batter. That also inhibits the up rising since pushing sideways pushes against less set/hard crust.</p>\n<p>And that's how we leave it (or &quot;leave well enough alone&quot;... no value judgment here).</p>\n<p>In the HG recipe, that is not what happens. Once it is &quot;nigh enough&quot; one cuts off the intensity of the heat from below so as to not burn the oil (its THAT hot underneath) and therefore the pudding. We take it out and end things. She continues, and is essentially addressing the modern oven humidity increase due to being sealed. In her recipe, the physicality is arranged to immediately begin dripping meat juices (&quot;gravy&quot; in the whole western world at the time, though in about three(+) generations Escoffier would formalize &quot;sauces&quot; and what was meant by &quot;gravy&quot; would forever change) on the top crust (softening it... and unlike our humidity, adding flavor!). And when nicely browned, she dried them rather than letting their crusting and internals soften while sitting. Even then, she layers on the flavor, using the butter as a dipper, like we might an au jus, the &quot;gravy of the meat&quot; either referring to the flavoring done letting the meat drip on them after reaching &quot;nigh enough&quot; or possibly also having an au jus nature by ladling more drippings on as a definite step. (I know I would, but I think this less likely for her meaning. There is no direct statement of it and it would have been easy for there to be.)</p>\n<p>So, the major difference would be that we do not flavor in the last portion of the cooking. (Which can't be only a couple of minutes long, since meat takes some time to drip enough to be useful as a softener while still cooking, or as a flavorant. It must be a stage at least 5-10 minutes long. &quot;Nigh enough&quot; must mean when a crust begins really existing on the top as it would just run off or puddle otherwise.) The oven humidity would keep the top crust just slightly pliable rather than hardened and hardening more so we get more of a croissant effect than a rock-like crust. For her, the drippings achieve this and flavor at the same time. Her cup of butter, clearly for dipping (so treating the pudding as a flatbread), makes it clear the pudding is meant to be a MOIST mouthful, and she expects it to be dry enough internally to need the butter to make that so. We don't address that unless eating the pudding before &quot;resting&quot; evaporation dries it out even more. Yet she isn't simply drenching it, but providing the butter dip to moisten as needed and to preference more so than to taste. Taste would probably be provided by the meat being included with each mouthful, topped off, so to speak, by whatever amount of butter was added in the dipping.</p>\n<p>Now, that leads to a &quot;what do you want to achieve by using the 'old tymey' method you have always been told existed&quot; situation. (Yes, no one was ever explicit, probably, in saying meat drippings provided ALL the oily liquid used, but they are clearly implying, to the extent that even using meat drippings for the oily material underneath the batter that is heated so high one has to eventually take a measure to keep it no hotter so it won't burn, that the oft-heard &quot;you can even use meat drippings for the hot oil you drop the batter into&quot; means &quot;Why not?&quot; rather than anything else particularly the impression of adding a flavor layer, rather than its characteristics being needed to set the times when you perform the steps and change the cooking. Modern baking may allow for shifting trays to even out heating of batches, but surely never says anything like &quot;when the cookie dough stops spreading immediately lower the heat&quot;... you make so few of that kind of adjustment even to heat and it usually doesn't matter since the heat takes so long to fall off, and you do it at times, not at marker points in the product's baking process. (Something to think about doing rather than slavishly changing a temperature at &quot;11 minutes&quot;...)</p>\n<p>So if you really desire to have a result more like the folks in 1800 or maybe 1600 might have had, you need to figure how to, when the top crust reaches a tipover point where it can absorb drippings, begin to provide drippings. Removing the humidity won't hurt if you provide the drippings. How? That's a trick I guess. A modern oven would be a hard proposition for both applying drippings directly from the cooking meat, and keeping the puddings baking at a higher temperature than the meat is. If your oven is convection, that could be both helpful and not. Drippings are two materials:  fat rendering out of the meat, and liquids being squeezed out of its cells by the heating proteins shrinking, thereby shrinking the cells. You could fry up a fat pad from a roast, beef or especially pork as it's often provided with more fat in the market as pork has so much fat wrapping it to begin with) \u2014 carefully slice it horizontally to a thickness experience would dictate, maybe begin at less than 1/8th inch thick, or as thin as you can safely achieve (perhaps easier if prepare it beforehand and make sheets when cold and stiffer) or just get some fat nets available some places and apply enough to achieve... enough... I feel like a 1700's recipe writer saying that!... but heated before application \u2014 so it'd be hot and rendering when needed, then open the oven and place portions on each pudding's top. Maybe paint each quickly with an au jus from pan drippings from the several preceding days, then apply. Maybe someone would invent a product if this would take off?</p>\n<p>Even better might be cooking bacon to the point of almost rendering or just beyond, if one works immediately rather than &quot;multi-tasking&quot;, still pliable, and layering it onto the puddings... fats AND meat liquids... that might be the very thing. Fatback might be going too far the fat direction (just using in the previous paragraph as &quot;the best it seems one could do&quot;), but &quot;to taste&quot; varies for every family and in families too.</p>\n<p>Then, no matter how you've physically used Yorkshire puddings in your house in the past, use them as a flatbread. When they are ready as the meal comes together should likely be very close to the point of sitting down and eating. Indian restaurants don't bring out your (already cooled, why not?) flatbread as they seat you and let it cool even more, or bring it straight from a refrigerator. It's FRESH as in basically just done in time for serving the meal, at least around here. Have a dipping fluid, even if providing modern gravy as well, and even if not butter. Think about pushing folks to tear some off, dip it in the dipping fluid, to personal extent, then using fork and spoon to add meat slices (not chunks) and gravy to one's personal taste, and placing it in mouth using one's fingers so requiring it to not be wet, rather moist, only using fork (or... spoon... if that wet!) to get it there if one has not yet the experience to get it right. I might suggest, also, seeing how one might not include a modern gravy. Meat, for instance, that is not &quot;well-rested&quot; has a great deal of moisture of the &quot;squeezed out&quot; type than rested meat. Nicer texture too, though I digress. Yes, liquid ends up on the plate, but that'd be stage one of moistening the torn chunk of pudding, sopping up the accumulation to the moment, then using the provided dipping liquid (the butter, or an au jus), then placing meat on it and eating). NO loss of liquid or flavor that any imagined reabsorption of liquids by cells during &quot;resting&quot; would have saved. (Rested meat seems less moist to me, as if evaporation did more of the work to the tented foil resting meat (no tight wrapping of the meat during resting, eh?) meaning the liquid is really lost, not retained. But I've only personal experience and thinking to rely upon there.) No loss because you sop them up. Part of the fun, too.</p>\n<p>That, I believe, would give you an experience much closer to what a person making HG's recipe would have ended up with, and how they would have physically brought it together and eaten it. If that is what you really want, then think about trying some or all of the above.</p>\n<p>If you truly want to do as she did, and get whatever you get, that being success, then hold off until you can try this on an actual fire, a backyard kind of thing, or more likely, a modern grill which can allow for the arrangement of parts up and down to achieve what an 18th century fireplace could have and that a modern oven usually really isn't built for if it does not at least have a rotisserie feature. Practice out the physicality beforehand though so you are not making design changes with metals and liquid fats at 400 \u00b0F!!</p>\n",

Boiling will definitely work, lower temperatures like 70 C will likely do so, but it will depend on the particular enzyme.\nSignificant pH change will reduce the effect of the enzyme but may not completely inactivate it: I suspect you don't want to go down that path because it will make your juice taste weird.\nGiven you are making jam you can take your juice, add sugar bring to the boil to denature any residual enzyme and then add pectin later.

It uses a steel jiggler/pressure regulator/counterweight which seems to be modern standard, having a 10mm hole in the bottom which sits upon the lipped metal steam-release tube atop the canner.</p>\n<p>The problem is that, although the manufacturer's manual states that normal operating pressure is between 72-88 kPa, and the gauge itself accommodates that pressure and beyond, when using the canner the gauge only shows around 50-55 kPa at the point when the steam is heavy enough to put the jiggler in a continuous rattle (at which point it should mean that it's at normal operating pressure, as regulated by the included jiggler).</p>\n<p>So, my first suspicion was that the gauge might be defective. However, if I apply light pressure on the top of the jiggler at the abovementioned moment, the gauge slowly begins to rise past 55 kPa, which suggests the gauge might be working right, then leading me to my second suspicion that the jiggler itself (which was the OEM that came with the canner) might actually be too light. There is no kPa marking on it, but one would expect it would be heavy enough to meet the specs of the manufacturer for normal operating pressure as per the manual. It weighs 78 grams.</p>\n<p>So, I went ahead and bought another jiggler that was stamped as being an 80 kPa regulator (which, at just over 11 PSI, is safe for non-acid food canning at my elevation, which is really my main objective in the first place). Well, that new one came in at only 74 grams, even lighter than my OEM jiggler. Then, I read a negative buyer's review on Amazon about the exact same-looking &quot;80 kPa&quot; jigglers being sold from China, in packs of three, where only one of the three would reach 80 kPa (suggesting that some of these being sold were indeed underweight). So, I then ordered two different supposed 80 kPa jigglers of different types from other sources (one of which was &quot;Supor&quot; brand, which is a trusted name brand of cookware here) to check the weights of those to compare as well. Those both came in at 69.7 grams!</p>\n<p>So, folks, my question here is how much is a standard 80 kPa jiggler really supposed to weigh?</p>\n",

Traditional recipes don't include that many savory mousses, and as you found out, the most commonly whippable substance, dairy cream, requires refrigeration. So your best chance to get to something that works is to search recipes for &quot;mushroom foam&quot; and give a preference to molecular gastronomy-related sources. It should be easy to check whether the thickener they use is heat-stable, there are many resources listing the physical properties of different thickeners, and you can usually find the information online. You may need a whipping siphon for most recipes of this kind.</p>\n<p>Also, since the texture and mouthfeel of differnet foams can be very different, and some of them may be a bit difficult to get right if you don't have much experience, it is best to get the materials for several recipes and experiment a bit, until you have found something that suits you.</p>\n<p>If this is too much hassle for you, you could relax your requirements of getting an actual, foamy mousse. You have already found out that you don't enjoy mushroom pudding, but you might turn out to like different kinds of mushroom dips, for example something based on cream cheese. Or a mixture of quark and mushroom bechamel. Just research different kind of dips, and again, experiment to pick one you like.</p>\n",

There are simply not enough carb-free ingredients in the plant world, and not enough vegetarian ingredients in the protein world.</p>\n<p>In that recipe, eggs have been used to provide the binding power which would ordinarily come from flour. But ordinary vegan egg substitutes (silken tofu, applesauce) assume that the eggs aren't needed for binding, because there are so many vegan binders out there; and the few that do provide binding (aquafaba, maybe banana) provide it through starches. The one cohesion-providing, gel-supporting ingredient I could think of would be xanthan gum, which is a carbohydrate but powerful in small amounts. The fact that I'm leaping straight to &quot;industrially cultured bacterial slime&quot; should give you an impression of what <em>sorts of things</em> you'll end up eating if you try to satisfy both of your diets simultaneously.</p>\n<p>As for almond flour: yeah, it provides taste and bulking and nothing else. The starch in other flours (including coconut flour) are responsible for hydrating into a gel and trapping gas, making porridge into pancakes. You need <em>something</em> to do that... and the things we normally use for that are either carbs or egg albumen.</p>\n<p>If you want to not spend extra time in the kitchen preparing a second dinner, cook extra and freeze leftovers.</p>\n",

It would take hours to dry them. When you add boiling water it's really only required in order to rehydrate them. You're not actually cooking them.</p>\n<p>You could instead just get regular dried Japanese ramen noodles (or even Chinese egg noodles) and cook them. These only take about 4 or 5 minutes. They're available in most Asian supermarkets and usually come in individual portions inside a larger pack, sometimes in 4, 6, or 8 portions. They don't usually come with a flavouring mix/pack. You'd have to make that yourself.</p>\n<p>Once your noodles are cooked, you'd need some kind of broth/sauce to put them in.  Just adding raw garam masala on its own to the cooking water won't make a curry flavour. It will taste absolutely horrible - trust me, I've tried that back in the day when I was totally clueless about cooking!</p>\n<p>A minimal curry has more than just garam masala in it. Curry is generally made by first gently frying onion, garlic, ginger and spices such as garam masala and chili powder to make a paste, before adding some liquid, such as a broth, and thickeners, etc.</p>\n<p>If you are not up for creating a curry sauce/broth from scratch, you can buy pre-pared curry paste/sauce mixes. You'll likely also need to add some buillon/stock cube to give it enough flavour if you want a curry flavoured broth.</p>\n<p>Obviously, all of this will involve more effort and time than just opening a pack of instant ramen. But it would certainly be more economical in the long run, save on packaging, and ultimately it could potentially taste much better if you put enough effort into making the broth, plus you get to control the ingredients, such as how much sodium/salt you put in it.</p>\n",

The name \u2018Bone Broth\u2019 does not fit in with culinary recipe terminology so forget the term \u2018broth\u2019 when referring to bone broth. Actual \u2018bone broth\u2019 is highly nutritious, good for your microbiome (gut healing) and is used as a first food for babies. Ideally, it should be cooked low &amp; slow for an extended period of time to extract the goodness from the bones &amp; marrow. The time depends on the meat (ex: I cook chicken for about 12 hrs &amp; I cook beef for about 24 hrs at just under the simmer point). It is usually cooked with some meat &amp;/or a mirepoix in it too for flavor. It can be made with parts that most people will throw away (or turn up their noses at such as chicken feet and cow hooves &amp;/or knuckles) but those parts are loaded with wonderful collagen. After the bone broth cools in the refrigerator, it should be gelatinous (the thicker the better). If it does not thicken, then it is just stock (or plain broth). When I cook bone broth, I reserve the first cooking for actual \u2018bone broth\u2019. I save this best quality broth for drinking. Warmed up, it is an excellent drink for first thing in the morning and is also an excellent food to break a fast with (for those of you who practice intermittent fasting). Then I will remove the initial bone broth from my pot and then recook the bones/meat for a second time. This second batch usually won\u2019t gel up like the first initial batch and that is what I save as my \u2018stock\u2019 for soups, pilaf, &amp; recipes (or I make ice cubes so I can add a few to a stir-fry to make a little sauce).</p>\n",

The end result is only slightly gummier, in many cases imperceptebly so.</p>\n<p>What won't work is the apple juice concentrate. Turkish delight is a type of candy; it is made out of sugar. The apple juice has nowhere enough sugar for that, it is still mostly water (I found a nutrition facts label stating it only has 38 g of sugar per 100 g). And the sugar in it is not sucrose, but fructose, which has a different consistency. Worse yet, it may also contain other stuff such as pectin, which will further do weird things to the final texture. So that is a big no-no. Even if you were using pure refined fructose, you couldn't expect to substitute it for sucrose (table sugar) and get the same results.</p>\n<p>So, in the end, you are quite free in your choice of starch, but the sugar has to stay, and in the exact amount as prescribed in the recipe, you cannot reduce it either. I cannot think of a product that will work well as a substitute. If the &quot;white&quot; sugar is what you object to, you could use brown sugar - the amount of molasses used to color it is so miniscule, it won't interfere with the candy-making process, beside giving you a bit of a discoloration.</p>\n",

Food hygiene regulations for commercial settings, strictly interpreted, are likely to mean that you wash your hands after the toilet and on arrival in the kitchen, i.e. again.</p>\n<p>If what you're washing off is from food prep, it's less clear-cut.  I still wouldn't recommend it in a professional setting, where there should always be a separate hand-wash  sink.  At home, when cleaning as you go, sometimes you have little choice.  I find this especially true when batch-baking, or when preparing a lot of fruit/veg for several dishes at once - you may need to wash the onion smell off before prepping dessert, for example.  Then you're either washing in or over the washing up water.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in between is dirty food-prep.  By this I mean tasks like getting soil off root veg transfer the soil to your hands.  You wouldn't want that in your washing-up water either.  Of course that's fairly unlikely as you'll need a sink to clean the veg, so you'll have somewhere to wash (once the veg is out of the way so you don't get soap on it).</p>\n",

That would be a ratio of 1:1:1:1 (flour, sugar, butter, eggs).</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to the theory that the muffin is a form of not-so-fancy cake, then it is worth to take a look at the ratio range suggested for such cakes. Shirley Corriher calls them &quot;regular shortened cakes&quot; and offers the following formulas for successful experimenting:</p>\n<pre><code>1. The weight of the sugar should be equal to or less than the weight of the flour \n2. The weight of the eggs should be equal to or greater than the weight of the fat \n3. The weight of the liquids (eggs and milk) should equal the weight of the flour. \n</code></pre>\n<p>She also recommends &quot;1 to 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder for each cup of flour, or 1/4 baking soda for each cup of flour&quot;.</p>\n<p>Of course, &quot;muffin&quot; is not a well-defined category, and has quite some overlap with &quot;cup cake&quot;. For some people, the above will be too cakey to count as a muffin, while others will bake cupcakes that are richer than it and still call them muffins.</p>\n<p>Also, muffins often include mixins, such as nuts, dried fruit, or chocolate chips. These are obviously not part of the basic cake formula above, but in my personal experience, the total amount of mixins should be no more than 20% of the total weight of the batter (=the sum of ingredients other than mixins).</p>\n",

I have used these ratios successfully for short pie/tart crusts, both sweet and savory, and for different types of cookie. But I must note that the textbook &quot;The professional pastry chef&quot; uses 1:0.88 flour to fat, with 0.38 sugar and 0.11 eggs added, as the basic formula intended &quot;as a base for cakes and\npastries or to line tart pans [and to prepare] nothing-left-in-the-showcase cookies&quot;.</p>\n<p>I haven't tried working with ratios outside the 3:2 to 2:1 range, but 1:4 strikes me as too buttery. It is probably not enough flour to hold together, you're more likely to end up with a stirrable roux base than a pastry crust. In fact, 1:1 is already a standard roux (although it might be a bit more pliable than stirrable if made with butter in an oven and then refrigerated).</p>\n<p>If you meant it in the other direction, you can very likely make a crust with 4 parts flour to 1 part fat. Then it will be difficult to work all the flour into the fat, and you will have to add more water than with higher-fat ratios to get a cohesive ball. The more flour you add, the more you are leaving classic shortcrust territory and going into something else - something like a hardtack with a bit of fat.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Your question is based on wrong assumptions. Depending on your preferred definition, they have made both coconut yogurt and coconut cheese, or they have never made either.</p>\n<p>If you choose a strict definition of &quot;yogurt&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot;, then it is biologically not possible to make yogurt or cheese from coconut milk. Yogurt is made by fermenting dairy milk with certain strains of lactobacillus (or a few other bacteria species), which digests some of the lactose in milk, and denatures the proteins to a certain degree, resulting in the well-known texture of yogurt.</p>\n<p>Coconut milk is chemically totally unlike dairy milk. If you add lactobacilluis to it, it cannot establish a colony, because the environment is totally wrong for it. You cannot ferment coconut milk with yogurt cultures.</p>\n<p><em>Update: somebody commented that one can ferment coconut milk. I still wouldn't see this as yogurt. First, it is unlikely that it is done with yogurt cultures. Second, I would be more inclined to see the result as related to kvass or to boza, than as related to yogurt. Third, fermented coconut milk won't have the fine denatured protein mesh that gives yogurt its texture, it will have to be thickened by other means to become yogurt-like, as described in the next paragraph.</em></p>\n<p>In recent times, some food producers have started making non-dairy yogurt replacement, some also using coconut milk. In that case, the lactobacillus is fermented in a medium in which it can establish a colony (I don't know if the coconut products are already added at that stage or not), and different plant-based ingredients are used to achieve a substance which has the optic appearance and the spoonable texture of yogurt, but does not taste like yogurt. Chemically, it is quite different from yogurt, but for many eaters, especially those starved for yogurt due to a restrictive diet, it is a good enough substitute.</p>\n<p>There are also plant-based cheese substitutes, and in recent years, they have also gotten rather close in texture to real cheese, especially if you are not picky about closely imitating an exact type of cheese, but are only looking for something that melts nicely on a casserole or provides the right tang and saltiness in a salad designed with Feta in mind. A lot of these also use coconut-derived products as part of their ingredients.</p>\n<p>But note that both of those types of product are 1) not actually yogurt (or cheese) but substitutes that have slightly similar sensory properties, and 2) are not made with the same method as cheese or yogurt. Since coconut milk does not behave like dairy milk chemically or nutritionally (in that case, nutritionally from the point of view of a lactobacillum), you cannot follow the same process as for dairy milk and get the same result. That would be like providing honey bees with cat food and expecting them to produce beeswax and honey.</p>\n",

By the time you get a hint of colour on the outside, the inside should be about done.</p>\n<p>Whoever said &quot;it's still stringy&quot;, implying &quot;still undercooked&quot; had no idea what they were saying.<br />\nSlightly undercooked chicken, it you cut or pull it between forks [don't eat it] will not be stringy, it will be very tender, like a rare steak compared to a well-done one. Over-cooked chicken will go stringy, then eventually completely dry, chewy &amp; bland, just like an over-cooked steak. Your aim is to hit a point between the two, because you <em>can</em> eat rare steak, but you cannot eat rare chicken.</p>\n<p>It's a tough job to get a thermometer in the middle of a bite-sized piece &amp; the degree of accuracy will be far too broad to be reliable.</p>\n<p>To test for doneness, smash the biggest piece on a plate with a fork, or tear it with two, to get to the centre. If it's got even the vaguest hint of pink in the middle, that one needs to go back in, the smaller ones are done. If you're still unsure, test the next largest piece.

                "body": "<p>Dough that is created using boiling water is known as choux pastry.</p>\n<p>There is no special reason why churros are made using choux pastry rather than other types of dough. It is simply that the definition of churros is that they are deep-fried long pieces of simple choux. You could ask just as well why stuffed peppers are made with peppers - you could make them with other vegetables too, you simply wouldn't call the result &quot;stuffed peppers&quot;.</p>\n<p>There is no general rule that only choux pastry can be deep-fried successfully. There are many other examples of deep-fried dishes made with other types of dough, such as donuts or mekizas.</p>\n<p>Your observation that a mixture of room temperature water and flour didn't make good churros can have different reasons. One is that not every random combination of flour and liquid creates a good, workable, tasty dough. Humanity has spent a lot of time in creating optimal doughs, and when you experiment randomly, your result will almost certainly be worse than if you follow a well-known process. Another one is that different doughs require a suitable preparation technique. Even if your water-flour mixture had the potential to produce something tasty, apparently a frying process which works well for choux pastry doesn't work for that type of dough and would have to be adjusted.</p>\n",

Chocolate is pretty much the only edible product where tempering is worth it.</p>\n<p>&quot;sounds an awful lot like cocoa butter&quot; - only because the explanation you came across was not detailed enough. Cocoa butter is a much simpler case. Only three fatty acids (oleic, stearic and palmitic acid) account for over 95% of its composition, and it so happens that, when cooled under the right conditions, they form a regular lattice with very pleasant sensory properties.</p>\n<p>Butter, on the other hand, is not just any old crystalline lattice. It is a complicated emulsion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fat globules, solid crystals, and water droplets are embedded in a continuous mass of semisolid \u201cfree\u201d fat that coats them all. <sup>*</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you start out with the mammal's udder packing fat into globules, which have their own membrane. When the butter is churned, most globules split, and out comes the semisolid fat. The solid fat crystals start clumping into each other, and some of the water comes out of emulsion (=buttermilk, in the original meaning of the word). Then you remove that free water, and you are left with a mix of structurally complicated components. It is not a single regular structure, and there is no mechanism for it to self-order, the way cocoa butter does.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, you are left with goat butterfat now. It will never go back to be butter, but as a consolation, it is still perfectly edible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>*</sup> McGee On Food and Cooking</p>\n",

Pure water/mustard mix will have noticeably lost its edge after only a day.</p>\n<p>It might depend on how, or if, your mustard is preserved initially. If it was water-based then canned, then knocking it back with vinegar &amp; a milder mustard powder would change the flavour profile but may also change its shelf-life. If it's vinegar-based initially, then I think your only option is to somehow dilute it. I would go with a milder home-made mustard.</p>\n<p>It may depend on where in the world you live as to the availability of mustard powders. Here in the UK the only ubiquitous one is an English, Coleman's, which will certainly not reduce the burn at all &amp; may actually increase it.<br />\nIn general, darker colour mustards are milder, lighter are hotter. 'Fake' ready-made mustards like McDonald's use all kinds of fillers, bulkers &amp; colourings to make a yellow 'mustard' with almost no taste of mustard at all, so don't let that fool you.</p>\n<p>If you don't mind changing the flavour profile completely, then will mix with mayo - which, in effect, just dilutes the mustard. Honey will sweeten it &amp; dilute somewhat. Sweet will mask the hot to an extent.</p>\n",

Leftovers are also a good option. A left over roast chicken carcass is as good as anything. In my opinion it's best if the meat is on the bone. It adds something extra special. On occasion I've also used supermarket cartons of meat stock, or even stock cubes.  The absence of one ingredient (meat) would never stop me from making one of my favourite soups!</p>\n<p>I've also made it completely vegan before by using vegetable stock cubes as the base for the soup. The rest of the ingredients are already vegan, basically root vegetables, onions, leeks, pearl barley, peas, pulses etc. Whatever you have available really.</p>\n<p>At its core, the broth itself is really just a vegetable soup. The uniqueness of the flavour (the thing that makes it &quot;Scotch&quot; broth IMHO) comes from the use of pearl barley which is used to thicken up the soup. Without the pearl barley, it would just be a vegetable broth. The other ingredients are variable/optional.</p>\n",

You can get a similar outcome, especially for proteins that benefit from a longer cook time. In this case, a pressure cooker can be a sort of short cut.  A lot depends on the particular cut of meat and the preparation, but you can certainly achieve tenderness using either method.  Some ingredients behave differently in a pressure cooker.  An example is onions.  Their aromatics and flavor seem to be muted at the high temperature of pressure cookers.  You can compensate by simply using more. In the case of onions, a lot more.

Parbake it in the oven, remove to a wire rack when internal temperatures are about 150F, and blast under the grill/broiler to crisp the skin immensely. This solves two issues: a slimey skin, since it is full of collagen and can taste like a layer of petroleum jelly, also when chicken cooks it renders stock. A lot of people serve roasted chicken with gobs of rendered stock stuck to it, which can be unappetizing.</p>\n<p>If she wants a &quot;springier&quot; mouth feel to the chicken pieces, you need to take it to more doneness. Cook to 185F internal temperature in the oven. For an 8lb bird, this is approximately 90 minutes at about 450F, covered in the oven. Still allow it to rest before carving.</p>\n<p>That's the last point. Most people carve their chicken straight out of the oven. When you do, juices can run out, and it can create a texture difference that's not pleasant, it's like chicken <em>jus</em> with cardboard. Let it have like 15 minutes before putting the knife to it so that the juices stay enmeshed with the muscle fibers, and the consistency is more like a cheese, soft to eat and not bathed in moisture.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Yes, you can make a caramel sauce without butter, but you have to add either water or... something else.</p>\n<p>If you use water, you'll get a pure caramel syrup that looks like honey. Personally, this is what I'd recommend because it's versatile on it's own, and can be repurposed into a different caramel sauce if you add another liquid, and patiently cook the mixture back to the proper temperature.</p>\n<p>In order to make a pure caramel syrup: Cook your sugar up to the desired temperature in a very large pot. Then, remove the syrup from the heat (I usually move to the sink to be safe), stand back, and using a towel or oven mitt to protect your hand, pour water into the pot. There will be lots of steam and bubbling, so please be careful. Then return the caramelized sugar and water to the heat, stir to dissolve the solid bits of caramel, and continue to cook until you've reached the consistency you desire. For a drip/glaze, you'll want to cook it to between 225 and 235 F, I'd think. It would be best to keep a cool plate to the side so you can drip a little of your caramel syrup at a time and judge its thickness as you go along.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind this will be a syrup by itself, so it will drip... and keep dripping. It will not set up, unless you cook it to the point where it's chewy/tough like @rumtscho warns. However, an easy workaround is to make a piping gel, either with gelatin or cooked starch using your caramel syrup in place of corn syrup or sugar.</p>\n<p>If you want an opaque syrup that has a more complex or creamy flavor, you'll need to use a dairy product instead of water. Butter is a go-to because it lends the most richness with the least amount of steam, and least dulce de leche/cooked milk flavor, and accordingly the least risk of curdling. Heavy cream is also a go-to because it's a very stable emulsion, which will help prevent any greasiness from separation, is still unlikely to curdle, and doesn't produce a lot of steam. Some of us really enjoy the tart dulce de leche flavor as part of a caramel as well.</p>\n<p>You can use lower-fat dairy products like half and half, or even whole milk. I can't tell you if 2% milk, skim milk, or non-dairy options will work, but if they can handle being boiled without curdling, then they'll <em>probably</em> work. I just can't promise it. The lower fat and higher protein your liquid has, however, the more danger you'll have of curdling. This danger is exacerbated by the high temperatures, and by the darkness of the caramel. The darker the caramel, the higher the acidity. So, if you use a lower-fat liquid (other than water, obviously), I would recommend letting the caramel syrup cool down significantly before adding the liquid. That will be more time-consuming, but will hopefully prevent curdling.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the substance you add, the basic procedure remains the same: Cook sugar in a big pot until it's the right temperature/color for your needs. Then, (allow the molten sugar to cool down if adding a low-fat liquid, or else take measures to protect yourself from the steam, and) add the butter or liquid. Return to the heat, stirring to re-melt and combine. Continue stirring and heating until it reaches a good temperature/consistency for your application. Consider using it to make a piping gel if you need more stability.</p>\n<p>Also, in case it's relevant-- I've tried making caramel using coconut oil, but that did not work. It totally separated. Adding heavy cream managed to emulsify it, but it still had a distinctly oily taste and feel to it, which I did not enjoy. I did not test using coconut milk or coconut cream, but considering that those tend to separate in the can, I'm skeptical that they would work well either.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>This is probably the 5th time I have said this on this site but make sure the meat is completely thawed. Brine is the process of using a saline solution to dehydrate and hydrate protein molecules. This has the effect of increasing moisture retention of the protein molecules. This just leads to more juicy meat. Often done to tenderise tough cuts of beef or very lean poultry. This process cannot happen if the protein molecules are frozen solid. Putting frozen meat in water could have some safety concerns as well.</p>\n<p>As for the curing salts, it is optional. Sodium Nitrates is the active ingredient in Saltpeter. Something humanity has used for many centuries. It is just a more potent and reliable version of a naturally occurring mineral. What it gives to the brine is rose pink color and a very pleasant Smokey flavour, but a 6 - 8 % salt solution will preserve the meat exactly the same with or without the nitrates. In the case of brines you add nitrates for flavour and color not for any additional preservation effect.</p>\n<p>Curing salts are coloured pink so that they are not confused with regular salt. Some care should be applied when dealing with it. Even just consuming a tiny bit can be dangerous. Keep it away from children and pets and mark all containers clearly. It is very potent.</p>\n<p>As for salts for brines you really need a fine salt. For curing whole cuts of meats coarse salt is what you need. I dislike using finishing salts for curing. I just find they have to many added minerals. This is not a problem when used as a table salt, but for curing it just complicates things unnecessarily. I also dislike using salt with iodine or anti caking agent. Anti caking agent leaves a very unpleasant sediment in your brine. Will not kill you but can lead to some off flavours. For a brine I would just use as pure a fine sodium chloride as you can find.</p>\n<p>A 1kg pack of sodium nitrates is probably be enough to cure anywhere between 1 to 3 metric tons of meat. For a 2 - 3 kg brisket I would use between 1 - 2 grams in a 5 liters of water.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting the difference between the two types of Prague powder. Any nitrates labelled type 1 is sufficient for most applications. Prague powder type 2 is specifically formulated for products that cure for many months, like cured sausages. They have a preservation effect that last a lot longer.</p>\n<p>As the nitrates are done for taste in a brine you can find a dose that has the correct smokey flavour for you. In any other types of curing like cured sausage, for example, you use the curing salts exactly as the recipe demands.</p>\n<p>As for regular sodium chloride it is important to weigh the salt. Different brands of salt vary greatly in volume and you need to be precise with this. As a general rule 6 - 8 % salt by weight per liter of water. This means 60 - 80 grams of salt per liter of brine. If we are using a 5 liter brine that means 300 - 400 grams of salt in the 5 liters.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you mentioned corning your brisket. If you want to corn beef then you have to use pickling spice. A Texas brisket is often brined but it only becomes corned beef if pickling spice is used in the preparation.</p>\n",

For recipes with Western European or US origin, you can assume the range to be somewhere between 18 and 25 Celsius (64 to 77 Fahrenheit), but for others, it can be very different. Finns sometimes use their balconies as an extra freezer, and Indians moving to other continents notice that their batters don't ferment properly when left out at the new &quot;room&quot; temperature.</p>\n<p>Deviations from that range (or within it) have different effects on your cooking, depending what you are dealing with. So if you want to research the consequences of suboptimal temperature and the optimal temperature range, you have to do it separately for each ingredient and each role it has in a recipe.</p>\n<p>The butter temperature is relevant in two cases. When you need very cold butter (e.g. for a liaison or for a pie crust), any room temperature is far from optimal, so you should use a fridge or a freezer. When you need soft butter, the softer the butter, the better, up to the point at which it starts melting, which is closer to 30 C. So with this room temperature, you will have butter that is colder than optimal. But you also probably don't have any realistic option of getting it better (quick-heating methods such as a microwave are more likely to melt it than to get it to the perfect stage), so you just have to use it as-is.</p>\n<p>For flour and sugar, I cannot think of any situation where their temperature matters, at least in the context of room temperature.

So finding &quot;how hot is Thai hot&quot; would require a survey of a large number of individuals across the whole country, and would give you a heuristic distribution instead of a specific level.  Nobody cares enough to fund this.</li>\n<li>It's difficult, if not impossible, to measure the heat of finished dishes.  The scoville measuring process is not designed for peppers mixed into foods, particularly since texture, competing flavors, cooking techniques, and even dining practices can affect the perception of heat.  For example, there are quite a few Chinese dishes which include dried whole chili peppers that are not meant to be eaten (like bay leaves).</li>\n<li>&quot;Local cuisine&quot; is a squishy concept that defies empirical evaluation. For example, is Anglo-Indian cuisine &quot;local&quot; or not?  An awful lot is eaten in British pubs.  And whether or not you include it makes a <em>huge</em> difference in any evaluation of &quot;how hot is British food&quot;.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further, lemme add that none of the above would tell you anything about how restaurants outside the original culture evaluate &quot;hot&quot;, which has more to do with their local clientele than their home country.</p>\n",

When they're soft throughout and warm at least in places, give them 30s on full, check, and maybe another 30s (having moved them).</p>\n<p>This assumes 2-4 sausages, say 150-200g or up to half a pound.

If you've been using it, you've tested that.  If not, heating water in there will test that (to be on the safe side, don't heat a clean smooth container of water to when you'd expect to to boil, as in very rare cases it can exceed boiling point then boil when handled).

It would have been mostly ethanol, but mixed with other waste compounds. A pure water-ethanol mixture created by yeast won't freeze (it shouldn't go above the alcohol content of wine), but it is not outlandish that, with enough other molecules swimming around, the whole mixture was not frozen solid at slightly below zero. So once their &quot;civilization&quot; had multiplied enough to drown in its own waste, it may have stayed liquid, even though it was in the freezer. Also, for such a long period of time, some enzymatic reactions might have happened even at those unlikely temperatures, leading to further decay.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, it seems that the yeast had an opportunity to multiply (at above zero) and took it.</p>\n",

                "body": "<h2>Let's talk potatoes</h2>\n<p>Potatoes are kind of bland &amp; starchy on their own. If you boil potatoes &amp; eat them with no salt, they just taste like nothing. Most &quot;plain&quot; potato preparations will use salt &amp; a bit of fat to make the potato taste more like potato. On the other end of the spectrum, you can put <em>a lot</em> of salt onto potatoes without them tasting &quot;too salty.&quot; Fast food french fries can have quite a bit of salt on the outside, and the starchy, bland inside will offset all that salt.</p>\n<h2>Potatoes to fix salty food</h2>\n<p>That last bit of the above paragraph basically explains why adding potatoes to a salty dish can work. Potatoes &quot;take&quot; a lot of salt themselves, so if you've put too much salt in a soup or curry, adding unsalted potato will equalize that as the potatoes &quot;take on&quot; and &quot;absorb&quot; some of that saltiness from the liquid they are in. Other bland, starchy foods work well as a &quot;salt sponge&quot; too--rice or pasta or even bread or flour tortillas. Potatoes have an advantage that they can either be broken up &amp; kind of turned into a thickener for the sauce/soup/whatever, or they can be left in big enough chunks that you can fish them out easily and not include them in the final product--where rice, pasta, bread, and tortillas are more difficult to make disappear.</p>\n<p>How much potato you need will vary, and in my experience there is no &quot;1 potato per <code>x</code> quarts of liquid&quot; formula, because there are just too many factors (including personal preference). The easiest way for me to estimate how much potato to add is to think in terms of &quot;how much extra salt did I add?&quot;</p>\n<p>You mention that you probably added 1 teaspoon too much salt, so per my advice, you'd think backwards to &quot;how much potato do I need to cook to directly add 1 teaspoon of salt to season it?&quot; and go from there. You might be able to add less or need more than that guess--but that's essentially what you're doing.</p>\n<p><strong>If you were cooking 1 potato by itself, how much salt would you use on it?</strong> If you would use 1 teaspoon of salt on 1 potato, then you need 1 potato to try to &quot;fix&quot; your &quot;1 teaspoon too salty&quot; curry. If you would use 1/2 teaspoon of salt on 1 potato, then you need 2 potatoes to fix your curry. Practically speaking, you probably need several potatoes (or many potatoes if they are small) to offset 1 teaspoon of salt by themselves.</p>\n<h2>But it doesn't always work</h2>\n<p>There's always an exception. If <strong>everything</strong> in the dish has absorbed too much salt, potatoes might not be enough to fix it. Potatoes do really well at taking on the salt from the sauce or liquid that they are cooking in. However, if there are meat &amp; veggies &amp; other things that have already absorbed &quot;too much&quot; salt, potatoes might not do the trick.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>I am not a nutmilk expert, but I do like milk more than most people I know, and I have dabbled in nutmilk.</p>\n<p>First thing, non-dairy creamers don't taste like cream. That's why some people will use them as sweeteners/flavor and add real cream as well. It's the best of both worlds if you take your cream with a little coffee.</p>\n<p>So saying, the only way to add milk flavor to your almond milk would be to add milk components. Lactose (sugar), whey and casein (proteins), butter fat, and more all contribute to the flavor of milk. The most noticeable factors affecting creaminess are going to be the proteins and fat. Proteins and fat are going to add texture as much as flavor though.</p>\n<p>You can recognize the significance of fat by itself within dairy milk. In my experience most people who actively like nutmilk tend to prefer skim, 1%, or 2% milk when they choose to drink it. But most people who prefer dairy milk will prefer whole milk, which is around 4%. If someone has a preference for skim or whole milk, they will likely find the other unpleasant, even though it's all the same animal's milk. And in light of that, if someone brings me a glass of milk that's watery instead of creamy, I'm not going to like it. It's not just the flavor, it's the texture.</p>\n<p>I've explored nutmilks because real milk is expensive and addictive (and I'm trying to lose weight. Why are cows do delicious?) Most of the nutmilks I have tried are lower fat, lower carb/sugar, and lower protein than cow milk. Many of them add sugar to improve the flavor. Many add stabilizer gums or emulsifiers to improve the texture.</p>\n<p>As far as creaminess goes, I would say the award goes to soy milk. It has higher fat and protein content compared to most nutmilks, but very little sugar. I only enjoy it with added sugar, which I try to avoid for personal reasons. Almond milk is the best compromise between natural sweetness and creamy flavor/texture in my opinion, and that's what I typically buy. The other nutmilks I've tried, while varying degrees of pleasant, really don't come close.</p>\n<p>However, I have to say I have not tried hemp milk or oat milk, but oat milk is getting a lot of hype for its creamy texture, and I would speculate it's due to the high fiber content. I can't talk much about it, but that might be worth looking into as well.</p>\n<p>So, how do you make your almond milk more creamy without adulterating it with actual dairy? My suggestion would be to increase the amount of almond solids that remain in your final product, and plan to shake vigorously before enjoying. This will also make it taste more like almonds, which is a good thing.</p>\n<p>If you explicitly want milk flavor as opposed to creaminess, then I'd suggest adding milk proteins (you should be able to get whey protein isolate pretty easily), lactose, or increasing the butter fat content with heavy cream.... But at that point, why not just buy regular milk?</p>\n<p>The final alternative is to do what the big brands do: add sugar and vanilla and don't think too hard about it. People tend to associate vanilla with creamy desserts pretty strongly in the US at least. Sugar tastes good, and vanilla is associated with creaminess, even if it's not creamy itself. How much attention do people actually pay to their glass of not-water anyway?</p>\n",

Soft olives are a ripe fruit, and hard olives get picked and pickled while still unripe. This is no different than, say, an unripe peach - the fruit is simply not juicy. And unlike some kinds of fruit, you cannot ripen olives at home - since they are marinated, they are already dead and cannot develop any longer.</p>\n<p>If you want soft olives, you have to buy the kind which is already soft. I would suggest trying to find Greek olives, they tend to be sold soft, as opposed to Spanish olives, which are sold in many supermarkets in Western Europe as tiny, hard, unripe and tasteless pieces.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p>I have been baking home-made pizza (home-made dough, toppings etc.). with great results, using a pizza steel and a ripping hot regular domestic oven. The base is crispy with leopard spots, and the crust puffy and chewey. The end result is far better than any of the pre-packaged supermarket varieties.</p>\n<p>I'd now like to freeze individual pizzas so they could be reheated from frozen in a regular oven without a pizza steel for friends and family etc. What would be the best way to do this to get a pizza close to the original? I'm guessing the best approach would be to part-bake the base, leave it to cool, then add the cold toppings and freeze. My pizzas only need 4 minutes to fully bake, maybe 5 if I am baking a lot as the oven temperature falls.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking of part-baking the base for 2 minutes. Would I need to do anything else for best results, including pricking the base or using pie weights to stop the dough rising? Is it worth adding a thin layer of olive oil to stop the dough drying out in the middle of the pie? Are there any toppings that would not freeze/reheat well? As to reheat times, I'm assuming 20 minutes in a 220C fan oven will be adequate, but advice much appreciated.</p>\n<p>The dough recipe I use is a regular twice-proved one (4 hours max), with bread flour, water, salt, sugar, yeast and olive oil. I don't use a poolish or long fermentation times, and knead this for 10 minutes in a stand mixer.</p>\n",

Many people prefer their legumes very soft, and work from a &quot;more is better&quot; attitude. Even if chickpeas are edible after some minutes, they are much creamier when you cook them for a couple of hours, and this is considered a plus by many eaters. On the other hand, undercooked legumes are frequently considered unpleasant, so cooks prefer to have a good-sized time buffer against such an occurrence. Then there is also the problem with too-old legumes: they never grow soft, but people sometimes mistakenly think that they are undercooked instead of too old, so based on these experiences, they tack on extra cooking time on their legume recipes, &quot;because last time I boiled it for X time and it wasn't enough&quot;. And then, note that traditional recipes come from kitchens in which there was always a fire going, so holding the pot longer was not causing any additional cost or inconvenience, and even today, there are only a few cultures where cooks are interested in shortening cooking time.</p>\n<p>These factors together combine to recipes where the recommended cooking time is considerably higher than the minimum sufficient cooking time for legumes, and if you are accustomed to check for doneness and turns off when ready, you might have noticed the discrepancy, while others just follow the recipe and don't give it a second thought.</p>\n",

Something which is akin to chewing on car tires. Same for any citrus. You can add spice but make sure it does not have salt in.

I prefer to use a wide metal baking tray instead because it has a lot of surface area for water to evaporate, baking dishes won't get your oven moist as quickly.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Presumably the dish was pre-heated to bread baking temperature (?450F?) but the water was at least 200F cooler. Water has a HUGE heat of vaporization. It takes 5.4 times as much heat to convert water to steam as it does to bring the same water from 32F to 212F. All that heat is sucked out of the surface of the baking dish , cooling it to 212F.</p>\n<p>Ceramics have poor heat conductance. Poor conductance means the water side of the dish cools down, but the other side doesn't. The cold side shrinks, but not the hot side. This produces a huge stress inside the ceramic material.</p>\n<p>Ceramics have low elasticity. This means the material can't bend (like steel) so the stress can't be relieved by warping.</p>\n<p>Ceramics also have poor tensile  strength. They break when stretched.</p>\n<p>Glass breaks in tension. It is incredibly strong in compression. &quot;Heat proof&quot; glassware is tempered.

                "body": "<p>You may be asking 'why don't we eat grass, after all it's everywhere', and the thing is we already do. All cereals (wheat, rice, corn, barley, etc.) are grasses which have been selectively bred to increase the size of the starch bearing part of the plants. The way humans have been approaching food is to improve what is already edible or learn to replicate biological processes that occur naturally on food we already eat. Most of what we eat and drink is produced by methods that have been used for thousands of years, only produced on an industrial scale, it's only relatively recently that science has given us the tools to look beyond that, including how ruminants digest their food. So as for why we have never looked at how to get nutrition from cellulose, partly it's that we never really looked at it as we concentrated on what we could already eat.</p>\n<p>The other reason we don't do it now is that it's not simple to do. You can't ferment cellulose, but you can ferment sugar. The problem lies in breaking the cellulose down into sugars in an efficient way - cellulose is designed to be tough and inedible by design, it's nature's way of giving plants structure. If it was easy to digest all animals would be eating it and it wouldn't serve its purpose.</p>\n<p>Cellulosic Ethanol has been a goal for years, being able to convert prairie grass into biofuel for example and it can be done, but it takes more energy to make it than comes out of the process, which works like this: First you use an acid to break down the cellulose, then you put it in a container of water with the same enzymes in a cow's gut or fungi from a termite to extract sugars. At this point you have a weakly sweet liquid. Yeast can be used to create alcohol, then it needs several distillation cycles to turn it into alcohol of any strength. The problem for ethanol production is that all this takes <em>heat</em>, and by the time you add up the energy and other costs to collect, transport and produce something useful you use more energy than you gain. You also end up with a lot of byproduct that you have to find a way to dispose of in an environmentally friendly way. You can't feed it to animals as there's no energy left in the waste, you could possibly burn it but that's not good for the environment.</p>\n<p>From a cooking perspective it is a bit different, as @rumptcho points out energy efficiency isn't a prime concern in home cooking. There's no reason you can't extract sugar from cellulose at home by replicating the industrial processes on a small scale, although you may need special equipment to control the production - perhaps modified home brewing equipment. Once you get the sugars extracted you could evaporate water off to create a sugar syrup, or even evaporate all of the water to make sugar granules. The thing to keep in mind is that sugar is all you get out of the process. Ignoring energy use, it's time-intensive way to produce prairie grass nectar.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Without having made biscuits myself, one of my trusted go-to authors, Shirley Corriher, claims to have discovered the secrets of great buttermilk biscuits. For her, these are low-protein flour, and a very wet dough.</p>\n<p>Note especially this step in her recipe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a large mixing bowl, stir together the self-rising flour, sugar, and salt. Work the shortening in\nwith your fingers until there are no large lumps. Gently stir in the cream, then some of the buttermilk.\nContinue stirring in buttermilk until THE DOUGH RESEMBLES COTTAGE CHEESE. It should be a\nwet mess\u2014not soup, but cottage-cheese texture. If you are not using a low-protein flour, this may\nrequire considerably more than 1 cup (237 ml) of buttermilk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the way, she is using these 237 ml of buttermilk for 255 g of flour, not your 300 g. And additionally, she uses 158 ml of heavy cream. Else the amount of fat should be comparable, 45 g for her recipe.</p>\n<p>Her recipe also requires the shaping you describe from observing your grandmother - since the dough is so wet, you have to scoop out a wet piece and dip it in flour, to get it to be self-contained.</p>\n<p>Her technique also requires you to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>place each shaped biscuit SCRUNCHED UP AGAINST ITS\nNEIGHBOR so that the biscuits rise up and don\u2019t spread out</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no egg white in her recipe, and egg whites don't give stretchiness, they make a dough that sits drier after baking, which is not something you want in biscuits.</p>\n<p>I advise you to exercise her technique, which should hopefully get you some very good biscuits. If it turns out that they don't have something from your grandmother's biscuits, for example the stretchiness, you will at least have a good base from which to continue exploring.</p>\n<p>As for the browning, it comes from a dough which is somewhat alkaline. Here I agree with Sneftel, you should leaven with baking soda, not baking powder. You will probably need more grams of baking powder than you are using now for baking soda, you can look that up easily. Also, instead of trying to fiddle with lemon and milk, you can simply use yogurt, which has a similar consistency to buttermilk, and you know it has not been oversoured. The second factor is sugar, some more sugar will help, if you don't mind the extra sweetness.</p>\n",

Drain well, add back to the pan, cover, remove from heat and let it steam in its own residual heat for 5-10 minutes.

I simmered it in fresh boiling water for another few minutes, let it steam for 5, but by then it was overcooked.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I have disposed the original packet with the cooking times on it.

This method is rarely found on the rice packet. I find it gives the most consistent results.</p>\n<p>Wash the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch. In a pot put 1 part rice to 2 parts water. Bring to the boil, stir once, and lower the heat to a minimum, cover with a lid and do not lift it again. Cook/steam on the heat for 10 minutes. Let it rest for 5 minutes off the heat.

                "body": "<p>This depends very strongly on what kind of oven you have.  Since there are many, many variations in oven design, I'm going to go over three contrary options based on my own personal experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Gas oven, freestanding and thinly insulated</strong>: with an oven like this, you can turn the heat down to a lower temperature, put the new food in, and expect that the new food won't cook a lot differently than it would if you allowed 10-15minutes for the oven to cool.  Gas ovens depend heavily on hot air convection from the gas flames to transfer heat to the food, and when you turn down the temperature, if the oven is not well-insulated, the temperature will fall almost as quickly as the food heats up.  The only food I wouldn't do this with would be something which was <em>very</em> sensitive to rapid overcooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Electric oven, built-in and well-insulated</strong>: my current electric oven, on the other hand, is very well insulated and relies on radiant heat from the walls of the oven to cook foods.  As such, if I turn it down from 450F to 250F, I can expect that foods inside the oven will still be exposed to heat higher than 300F for at least 1/2 hour.  As such, if I need to drop the oven temperature for cooking reasons, I prop the oven door open.</p>\n<p><strong>High-end electric oven with exhaust fan</strong>: I've also had the chance to cook in higher quality ovens that contain an internal exhaust fan with an exhaust pipe to the outside.  These ovens actively cool themselves off when you lower the temperature, so going from 450F to 250F would take less than 10 minutes, despite the thick insulation.  With this oven, you just turn the heat down and put the food in.</p>\n",

There are even luxury ovens which are intended to never be turned off, and always use a constant temperature; communal village ovens used to work on the same principle.</p>\n<p>Modern ovens are rarely built that way, for several reasons. But still, you can expect (or hope) that the heat saved in your well-preheated oven is significant, and that &quot;the amount of heat the oven continues to add to maintain the temperature&quot; is the negligible one. So I would assume that the new dish will get heated much higher than per recipe.</p>\n<p>From there on, it is a matter of your dish's temperature sensitivity. If you place a cheesecake or a piped meringue into your overheated oven, you are asking for trouble. But if you are, say, roasting a pumpkin, then you probably won't have much trouble from the initial high heat. For a steak, you will likely be finishing it on a pan anyway.

Obviously, I know chicken isn't vegetarian, but if you need to avoid bacon there are vegetarian options for imparting the flavouring that you would otherwise get from bacon.</p>\n<p>If it's a smoky flavour I want, I use Spanish smoked paprika. I frequently use it in lentil soup when cooking for vegetarian friends to avoid using bacon/ham. I use it in combination with vegetable stock cubes. Another smoky-flavoured spice is chipotle chili flakes - obviously this is much spicier than paprika, so be careful!</p>\n<p>Another possibility is to use something like dried mushrooms, such as porcini; these have an almost pork-like concentrated umami/savoury flavour.  I've also seen porcini mushroom powder, which can be used similarly, if you want to avoid pieces of mushroom.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you could use a combination of all of these.</p>\n<p>Another option, not vegetarian, is what is often referred to as Italian MSG - salted anchovy fillets. I know it sounds a bit weird, but these can add a wonderful salty meaty/umami flavour to dishes. Maybe just use two or three fillets. They will dissolve almost completely in a sauce.  They're a strong flavouring but in small quantities they don't add a fishy flavour at all.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Personally, this is the sort of situation that I think is fantastic for experimentation. My recommended medium would be a chiffon cake that depends on whipped egg whites for structure. Keeping every other aspect of the batter the same, try each method, bake the cake the same way, in the same pan, and look at the crumb.  Is it even, fine, loose, dense, airy? How thick is the crust? How does it feel when you bite down? Crumbly, soft, spongey, firm, dry? That's going to give you the best answer (and an excuse to eat cake.) Alternatively, or additionally, just bake 2-3 egg whites worth of meringues directly to avoid excess. Take some pictures of your experiments if you decide to perform them a few weeks apart.</p>\n<p>Generally, this is what I've gathered for myself from various sources and/or experiments and accidents:</p>\n<p>The longer you wait to add the sugar, the denser your final product will be. One potential issue is that the sugar might not thoroughly dissolve before you've finished whipping your meringue, leading to extra caramelization on the outside, possibly even graininess, or (depending on the use) a separation of sorts. I've had a few cakes come out with a denser layer at the bottom with a much lighter, but drier crumb higher up.</p>\n<p>I can't precisely explain the physics, but you can overwhip egg whites into a grainy mess. That kind of curdling is caused by proteins coagulating too much together. So, the addition of sugar not only adds stability to the meringue, but inhibits the proteins from binding together quite so quickly or easily, and so helps prevent that curdling. Based on this, I think it's reasonable to assume that if you wait too long to add sugar to a meringue, some of the proteins will have already bonded too tightly together for the sugar to properly interfere. As a result, you wind up with some tighter egg protein matrix and some looser, as well as sugar syrup that's not as well distributed throughout the foam - meaning the sugar doesn't always get where it needs to be to stabilize the foam, and instead weighs it down unevenly. Not great texture-wise, and worse than that, unpredictable.</p>\n<p>So what's the problem if you add the sugar too soon? Basically, it works too well to stabilize and inhibit the foam's formation. I've done that multiple times because I personally prefer it for chiffon cake. The sooner you start adding the sugar, the more thick and velvety smooth the meringue becomes. That can be an issue because when you bake it up, the texture is very fine. It dries out easily, and where it's not chalky, it's marshmallow-y. I've never bitten into a piece of insulation foam, but I imagine it has a similar texture to a meringue that got sugared at the beginning. Not bad, IMO, and fairly predictable, but definitely not ideal by most standards for most applications.</p>\n<p>I've never actually tried adding the sugar to the egg whites the day before, so I can't speak to that specifically. I'd imagine it would result in an extremely fine foam, and lead to a dry or spongey final product as well - either of which might be exactly what you want for a given application.</p>\n<p>That's the most difficult aspect of this question to completely address. French meringue can be used in multiple applications, piped and baked to dryness, broiled or torched on a pie or for baked alaska, as a last minute dairy-free sub for whipped cream, for pavlova, as the non-chemical leavening in cake, a base for a buttercream... The desirable amount of sugar and best time to add can vary by application, and more importantly by person.</p>\n<p>I'd imagine various people swear by their own methods for their own reasons, possibly because they favor different textures, or different desserts entirely, or their mixer runs at a different speed, or their preferred bowl is a different shape, both of which could be significant. So again, I really think this is the kind of question you're best off answering through direct experimentation. There is no one best method, any more than there's one best cake.</p>\n",

I have a measuring cup sitting on mine when it's in the drawer, and I've done that for years without an issue. A larger object should still be okay as long as it doesn't exceed the capacity of the scale, at some point it will damage the sensor. Although, if you are concerned you can just stand it up on its side instead of putting something on top.</p>\n<p>Mechanical scales are a different story as most of them use springs, keeping a load on a spring long-term can lead to it deforming and/or weakening prematurely, leading to errors in precision.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Not a full answer, but some steps to troubleshoot/may help:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Hang a manual oven thermometer in as close as possible to the place as you would normally put your food. Make sure you read it through the window without opening the oven. You may have to move your racks so that you can get the thermometer to the same height as you food would be at. Do a dry run of cooking your most basic recipe--preheat, open and close the oven exactly as you would normally, etc., just without food and keep notes of what the thermometer says (start, end, and maybe 4-6 times evenly spaced through the process). Let your oven cool completely, then same process again, but with convection mode on. If you have a friend or relative who will let you repeat the process in their oven, do that, too. (Manual thermometers are extremely cheap, so you can also get several and hang them in different places.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Buy a box cake mix (yes, yes) and prepare it exactly as specified on the box, cook at exactly the time and temperature specified, etc. Weigh it before and after cooking to calculate moisture loss. Take notes about the doneness in various spots: edge, one third of the way in from the edge, center, top, and bottom. Report back here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Try putting your food in a Dutch oven inside the oven, turn convection mode on. If you don't have a Dutch oven, you can put your normal dish on a cookie sheet with an oven safe bowl covering it, or you can use foil (but make sure the foil is fully encasing your food and <em>secured</em> so it doesn't get blown around). (It might be worthwhile to sacrifice another box cake mix here just for consistency, so you can compare the same doneness points as from step 2.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thoughts: Convection oven is basically the same as a normal oven+fan, but of course there are options even with normal ovens.</p>\n<p>Normal ovens usually have a significant temperature gradient from top to bottom (hotter at the top), the fan on a convection oven distrutes the heat more evenly. If the power is the same, with the fan on it will be--compared to fan off--cooler at the top and hotter at the bottom. Since most people tend to cook closer to the middle or bottom, for most people the convection mode will be hotter (at the same power) than conventional. However, some convection ovens try to adjust the power for you based on mode, so the power might be different for the same temperature setting depending on if the fan is on or not. (This might also be a place where things can go wrong.)</p>\n<p>The exact shape of the interior and the arrangement of the heating elements/burner can also cause hot or cold spots in an oven...you only really care about the spot your food sits at.</p>\n<p>Some ovens also have options re: which heating elements are on (top, bottom, both). Convection ovens may have fan speed, etc., options, too. It may be worthwhile to cuddle up with the manual and list out all of the options which your oven has, then try each one from a cold oven with the temperature set the same and thermometer in the same place, note temperature as intervals that make sense for the types of recipes that you normally cook. (It can also be helpful to do this for the minimum and maximum temperatures which your oven supports, so that you know the full range actually available.)</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Slow-cooked meats that get shreddable (pork butt, beef chuck, etc) are a little different than other cuts, like steaks and rare roast beef.</p>\n<p>As a pork butt (or similar cut) cooks and breaks down, it loses the structure that holds juices in. Instead, the braising liquid contains much of that &quot;juice&quot;--including gelatin &amp; melted fat. This is essentially why the meat is even shreddable. The act of shredding/pulling the meat just separates the meat  in the spots where the connective tissue has already released the muscle fibers from each other, compared to slicing where you are cutting the muscle fibers apart where they would not naturally separate.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, shredded or pulled meats are shredded while still warm/hot, then dressed with the braising liquid, sauce, or gravy to keep the meat juicy. If a recipe calls for letting the meat sit a short period before shredding, it us usually related to allowing it to cool to prevent burning yourself, rather than allowing it to rest, the way we do for a steak.</p>\n",

Having a button popped out with the jar sealed, then popping in as you open it, is a sign to discard the food.</p>\n<p>What happens normally in the canning process is the hot product is placed in the jar, then the lid on top. As the product cools, it creates a negative pressure pulling the &quot;pop top&quot; into the jar and sealing the lid to the jar lip.</p>\n<p>If the lid is popped out, the seal is still OK, but something inside is wrong.

Red cabbage, and other cabbages for that matter, don't have that much liquid in them. As they break down they release moisture, much of which will escape out of the pot as it cooks, so you just add a splash now and again to keep it wet enough. You can also use other liquids, I've seen people use wine, I've used apple juice/cider. It all depends on the flavor you want.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Your process skips the scalding step for the milk.</p>\n<p>To get the proper consistency for yogurt, you have to boil it up once. This has two functions: it kills bacteria which might outcompete the culture, and it changes the shape of the proteins, making a difference in the way they cross-link together, and giving it the proper final texture. This is especially visible in your case of using unpasteurized milk, but it actually also has to be done with store-bought (pasteurized) milk for optimal results.</p>\n<p>You don't have to keep it at the boiling temperature for long, but you have to bring it to 85-ish or above (Celsius) for at least a few seconds. Afterwards you have to let it cool down to the incubation temperature - and as said in the comments, 100 F is actually too low, it has to incubate at 42 to 46 C depending on the culture you are using and on the sensory properties you want to have in the final product. A higher temperature will give you a firmer yogurt, more whey separation, and a higher proportion of acids, especially acetic acid.</p>\n<p>The fat won't give you a firmer or a less firm yogurt, but it does give you a creamier mouthfeel. Generally, full-fat yogurt is perceived as being more pleasant than skimmed yogurt, although if your personal taste goes towards dryness/firmness, it may add a different texture dimension which distracts from the taste you are after. So you can indeed experiment to find your optimal results. Before you invest the money in a centrifuge, consider making a few batches of yogurt with store-bought full-fat and skim yogurt, to see if you indeed like the skim version more.</p>\n",

The vacuum bags provide convenient freezer store as well.</p>\n<p>But.... Thing is that just reducing the risk of mold won't stop your highly nutritious human food from decaying in other ways. Once eggs are out of the shell, they don't last long. Something with high water content, honey/sugar, and potential bacteria from the raw egg, not to mention the environment, is going to start fermenting, and agar is straight-up used to make those little culturing plates used in labs. Fermentation will still happen at fridge temperatures, even if it takes longer. Your sludge sounds like a great substrate for nightmares, as you've evidently witnessed on the mold-front, so for the sake of any human interacting with this stuff, I'd honestly recommend preparing smaller portions.</p>\n<p>You can do that more easily by blending the egg to really liquify it, then weighing the egg and the other ingredients. Once you know the weights of everything, scaling the recipe is simple, and the liquefied egg is easier to measure.</p>\n<p>The egg liquid can be preportioned and frozen (use a silicone ice cube tray if the amount of egg per portion is too tiny. Then just put the egg cubes in a freezer proof bag for long-term storage and hope for the best.)

My concern would be that the drying (or pasteurization) might affect the proteins in a way that these humans like even less, lol.</p>\n<p>But as rumtscho said, this food is simply not intended to last. Barring some kind of commercial preservative/mold-inhibitor approach, you're going to have to prepare it differently, prepare less, or decide if it's still cost-effective to make your own with the amount of loss each month.</p>\n",

Storing with silica gel might encourage you to keep them around longer, rather than just keeping small amounts around or working with whole spices.</p>\n",

The wheat bread with yeast is ideally made with several cycles of kneading and rising. A gf bread is not kneaded, just mixed, and then has to rise once. The quickbread is also not kneaded, but it has to be baked immediately, without a rising time. So, if you want to make any of these with a bread machine, you have to use a program that was engineered to deliver the needed conditions.</p>\n<p>If your machine has no gluten-free program, then it is unlikely that any of the other cycles matches the conditions needed for gluten-free bread. There is some likelihood that some of the programs that you have can match some kind of recipe such that the result is not inedibly terrible, but discovering such a combination would require a lot of experimentation, and the result will only be valid for your exact breadmaker model. Also, the result is unlikely to be especially good.</p>\n<p>In the end, if you are making the bread frequently, it may be worth investing in a new breadmaker, after researching which one has a decent gf-program (and then you will have to find out which recipes work - which may or may not use the exact flour mixture you have). If this is a one-off occasion, just buy the bread from a store. GF-bread is very finicky, and probably not worth the learning curve if you won't make it regularly.</p>\n",

My idea was to use some sturdy stainless steel plate that should withstand the 500 degree Celsius inside the oven, which I will manually rotate with the pizza on it.</p>\n<p>I bought some custom-made 316 stainless steel plate, but it suffers from the issue I suspected might happen. The heat transfer from it to the pizza doesn't occur very effectively even though it has a much higher thermal conductivity than cordierite, possibly because its <em>emissivity</em> is significantly lower (at least when polished and clean) and thus any area in the dough which doesn't contact the plate perfectly gets very little crusting.</p>\n<p>Another thing not helping is that my dough is quite sticky and requires plenty of flour in order to leave the peel, so that also adds a layer of barrier which probably reduces crusting. I tried with (coarse) semolina too and the results were worse.</p>\n<p>So I want to improve the emissivity of the plate. My question is whether seasoning the plate with oil could achieve that, and whether seasoning in such high temperatures is problematic?</p>\n",

In that case, you will most likely end up with sharp seed pieces that are left in after straining, defeating the purpose of a seedless puree. Second, thickeners need the correct conditions to work. As you listed pectin, you have to make sure that you are within the correct ratios of sugar and acidity for the type of pectin you are using, and you have to warm the puree to the needed temperature.

Whereas when the upper bowl touches the water, there\u2019s a huge thermal mass that can give you a much larger flow of energy to the bowl, which can overheat the food or create local hot spots (at the bottom), simply because it gets heated too fast, so that e.g. egg dishes get fully cooked or curdle.</p>\n",

The articles you read are correct - the temperature in the double boiler is lower when the inner vessel does not touch the water.</p>\n<p>First, in a double boiler, the steam-air-mixture will not get above 100 C. Instead, the steam will expand. This is why you see a cloud of vapor rising out of the double boiler. And new, cold air comes in, so you don't even have a 100 C steam, but a below-100 mixture of air and steam.</p>\n<p>Second, the food does not touch the steam. It touches the inner vessel. On the outside, the steam touches the inner vessel. But it is not simple conduction of heat that happens on the boundary; the steam also condenses on the surface of the inner vessel, which uses up a lot of energy, and reduces the temperature of the inner vessel. (This is also why steaming is a slower cooking method than boiling).</p>\n<p>Third, I am not entirely sure what the temperature equilibrium of a double boiler would be - whether it is very close to 100 C, or noticeably below it - but you usually don't cook in a double boiler at equilibrium. It heats up slowly (see the above two points on heat transfer) and that time allows you to heat your food very gradually. If you were to hang the inner vessel directly into the water, it would soon come up to 100 C (especially the thin steel vessels that are frequently used for double boilers) and then the bottom of your food would be prone to overcooking. In such a case, you can just about save eggs, if you stir or whisk them with sufficient intensity, but any chocolate will distemper badly.</p>\n<p>So, in summary, if you want your food to get heated slowly, don't let your double boiler's inner vessel touch the water.</p>\n",

Everything is prepped in advance, when the order comes in the item is finished and plated, timing this among the cooks so that individual dishes are done together.</p>\n<p>At home, many things can be streamlined with good prep work, a solid understanding of timing and cooking procedures, warm or cold plates, and patient guests.

                "body": "<p>Let me just address the timing aspect of this question, because I do this all the time for large guest dinners (Christmas eve, Passover, etc.).  I'm going to give an example from my upcoming holiday dinner this weekend.</p>\n<p>There's two stages to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Figure out which things can be made ahead and reheated or served cold.  Restaurants do this constantly.  For example, just about every dessert served in most restaurants was frozen when you sat down -- the dessert chef comes in and makes large batches once a week.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Figure out all of your timings and work backwards from when stuff has to be served. Spreadsheets help.  Again, chefs and line cooks do this all the time; if a table orders the prime rib and the sole, one line cook will start the rib 20 minutes before the other one puts the sole on, so they'll be done at the same time.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second part is simple to say, but hard to actually do, and realistically impossible for dishes you've never cooked before.  Also beware of scaling up; I've found out the hard way a few times that making twice as much of something substantially and unpredictably affects the cooking time.</p>\n<p>So, examples: this weekend I'm doing a multi-holiday dinner since we have the confluence of Easter, Passover, and Ramadan.  Dinner will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>matzoh and two dips, halek and mizra ghasemi</li>\n<li>deviled eggs</li>\n<li>herb salad</li>\n<li>saffron matzoh ball soup</li>\n<li>caramel pots de creme</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both dips and the deviled eggs can and should be made ahead, so I'm making them the day before.  I just need to remember to take them out of the fridge one hour before the guests arrive (6:30pm), to come up to room temp, so that goes on my schedule at 5:30pm.  The pots de creme get made two days ahead, and don't come out of the fridge until 7:30, while people are eating the soup.</p>\n<p>The matzoh ball soup has multiple stages, and takes a minimum of 2 hours, and that's assuming you do the stock--&gt;soup and the matzoh ball making in parallel.  I could make this easier by making the stock a day ahead, but I don't have room in my fridge (this is where restaurants can do things I can't).  I don't want it to be ready until 7:30, though, because it's the 3rd course, which complicates things because that means I have guests arriving just at some critical stages, so I actually stretch out prep.  So I prepare my timeline like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4:00 make matzoh ball dough, put in fridge</li>\n<li>4:30 chop vegetables, start stock simmering</li>\n<li>4:45 mince herbs for herb salad</li>\n<li>5:00 form matzoh balls</li>\n<li>5:30 put matzoh balls back into fridge; stock is done.  Take apps out of fridge.</li>\n<li>5:45 put soup ingredients into stock, put on simmer</li>\n<li>6:00 dress herb salad</li>\n<li>6:15 put seasoned water on medium</li>\n<li>6:30 add balls to boiling seasoned water; soup is done, cover and turn off heat.  Guests arrive.</li>\n<li>6:45 serve dips and matzoh, plus eggs</li>\n<li>7:15 serve herb salad</li>\n<li>7:30 Soup &amp; balls ready.  Combine and serve as soon as guests are done with the salad.</li>\n<li>8:30 serve dessert</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So yeah, it's complicated, and unlike a restaurant it's made more complicated by the fact that you want to attend your own party (unlike restaurant staff, who will stay in the back).  On the other hand, you're just preparing a tiny handful of dishes.  Plus this is only a reasonable timeline because it's my 25th time making matzoh ball soup; if it were my first or 2nd time, I'd want to give myself another hour or more.</p>\n",

Underripe jackfruit, the standby for vegan everything, might work well also.</p>\n<p>So ... if you're preparing a &quot;vegan ceviche&quot;, I'd recommend a mix of avocado and hearts of palm, in lime juice and spices.

                "body": "<p>There are only a rather small handful of cases where refrigerating some type of food is potentially problematic. They generally fall into one of four categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Certain lipids congeal or solidify when they get down to typical refridgerator temperatures. This can cause them to separate out if they are part of a soup or sauce (often forming a scum-like layer on top of the other liquids if stored in bulk), or to solidify and cause things to stick together. Usually this can be solved by reheating and mixing, but in some cases it can completely ruin a sauce or gravy.</li>\n<li>Similarly, how much salt and other solids you can dissolve in a liquid is dependent on temperature, and chilling the liquid can cause such solids to crystalize or precipitate out out of the solution. This is more often an issue when putting things in the freezer, and can almost always be solved by reheating and mixing, but is a serious pain when it happens.</li>\n<li>A major component of perception of flavor has to do with olfactory perception of volatile (in the proper scientific sense of the term) compounds in the food. These compounds evaporate and disperse less readily at cold temperatures, so chilling certain foods can have a very significant impact on their perceived flavor. Famous examples of this include various varieties of wine and sake, which often taste noticeably different when served chilled compared to being served room temperature. In general, just warming the food up again will resolve this.</li>\n<li>Starch recrystallization, the primary process which causes bread and similar foods to go stale, happens more rapidly at typical refrigerator temperatures (as compared to room temperature, it actually happens even more rapidly at colder temperatures, up until you get to the freezing point of water, where it stops completely). This means that things like bread stored in a refrigerator go stale faster than they do if stored at room temperature (but, on the flip side, they generally don\u2019t become moldy). Unlike the others, this process cannot be completely reversed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these are really safety issues. All three except the last one <em>might</em> affect canned tuna, but I would think it\u2019s unlikely to be a significant issue given that canning it in the first place already has a pretty big impact on the taste.</p>\n",

Tin has several different crystaline structures that are stable at different temperatures. The atoms in the allotrope of Tin that is formed at 13.2C (56F) are packed less efficiently that normal tin, and thus the tin can crumble and corrode. This can cause damage to the tin can that could lead to food spoilage. This process is known as Tin Pest.</p>\n<p>Tin itself is not very toxic, so any direct tin contamination would probably not be a concern. So in your case, even if your tuna can <em>was</em> made with tin, you'd be OK, and the short amount of time invloved means that spoilage would also not be a concern.</p>\n",

Right now we don't sell that much (rice is WAY more popular), so I just fill a third every couple days. However, tourism season is going to be starting very soon, and everything the prep kitchen does is going to be quadrupled (at least). So I'm going to need a better way to make mash.</p>\n<p>Here's the problem - the kitchen isn't really that well equipped. The previous chef almost scuppered the restaurant due to terrible management (despite it being one of the most profitable ones in the city), so all the gear I have to work with that might sort-of do the job are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a single generic low-quality long-handled masher. Just about adequate to the task of doing one batch in a lumpy mediocre manner with a lot of effort kinda slowly.</li>\n<li>2 big 'ol immersion blenders. The internet tells me this will result in gummy gluey mash, but would be faster and more even.</li>\n<li>My own personal potato ricer from home. This does not scale to restaurant quantity very well, but is probably about as fast as the masher, and would be much higher quality.</li>\n<li>China caps I could ostensibly use like a tamis? This seems like it would be laborious and difficult, though.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given all this, despite my knowledge of solid home-cooked mash, I don't know how to make decent mash at high volumes at a poorly-equipped restaurant. If anyone has any advice, it would be highly appreciated.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thanks for the responses! To respond to some questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quantities currently are a deep third insert needed every day, i.e. a fairly large, but reasonable for a family (with leftovers), home pot of mash. This will be quadrupled within a month when tourist season properly hits.</li>\n<li>Stand mixer = no.</li>\n<li>They're profitable, but don't seem keen to actually spend any money. This restaurant is owned by a corp that also owns 2 of the other most profitable restaurants in the city. For an example of how shit they are re: money-spending: we have a tomato dicer that's needed a part for multiple months, and we have to make bruschetta in large batches basically every day. Also the prep kitchen sinks don't work now despite them knowing about a problem months ago. I literally collect water in a bus pan and dump it in the toilet, and wash my hands in a bucket I fill with hot sanitizer. It's a mess.</li>\n<li>The chef at this restaurant is my actual friend (part of why I got the job with no experience - he just knows I have a breadth of knowledge), and he hates many things about how the restaurant/company is run. He's also basically saving the restaurant and consistently trying to make better/more efficient dishes. I don't think he can make them spend money. He also technically isn't the chef despite having all the duties and being paid the same as a &quot;chef&quot; would be.</li>\n<li>I've only been working at the place for a month, and I've had minimal dealing with the GM, so I am just now starting to get comfortable with questioning things. My de facto superior has been working at the place for 3 months. The actual experienced people got poached by the chef who nearly got the place shut down, and was literally stealing from the company. I still don't understand why people left to go with him, but that's apparently the case.</li>\n<li>I will ask the chef about dried flakes, but based on him trying to actually improve the restaurant top to bottom, I'm not sure he'll be down with them.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Drain the water from the rice</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For step 8, one recipe was ok with washing the partially cooked rice further, to get rid of any extra starch floating around.</p>\n<p><strong>My questions:</strong><br />\n<strong>Question 1.</strong> When I cooled the rice by pouring cool water in step 8 and then drained the water, the rice lost the saltiness that's crucial to the biryani taste. The end result was a bland biryani. Even the spiciness of the whole spices added to the water was missing. What exactly is the point of adding salt, spices and ghee to the water, if the water is to be thrown off? How can the salty taste be retained?</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2.</strong> If I do not drain the water, the rice tastes good (because the salt and spices are retained), but it ends up getting cooked further and becomes mushy or sticky. Is there a way to cook the rice without it become mushy, but also not having to drain the water? The rice should get fully cooked eventually though.</p>\n<p>None of the recipes I checked, mentioned the details of how to retain the taste and flavour while still ensuring that the rice does not get mushy or sticky. I primarily use jeera rice, but sometimes use basmati rice too.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>From all the biryani recipes I've followed, I agree that it seems strange that after you par-boil the rice that it is rinsed in cold water. This would wash off any flavouring on the outside of the rice, but shouldn't affect any flavour absorbed by the rice. If the stock the rice is cooked in is well flavoured with spices, it will change colour slightly and this should be reflected in the colour of the partially cooked rice, which is a good indication the flavour has penetrated. This is the method I use, and is pretty much common in all biryani recipes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wash your rice well in cold water to get rid of any excess starch. You need at least 3 good changes of water to do this, you will not manage to get the water completely clear but it should not be milky. Some recipes call for the rice to be soaked for 15-30 minutes in cold water, I avoid this as some varieties of rice can easily overcook. Place the rice in a sieve or colander to drain well.</li>\n<li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil with salt, hard masala (e.g. bay, cinnamon, cloves, mace, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamon etc.). After about 10-20 minutes gentle simmering with the lid on, the stock should be salty and well flavoured with the spices. Apart from taste, the stock should have taken on the colouring of the spices and not be completely clear, it should have a slight greenish-brown tinge to it.</li>\n<li>Add your rice, return to the boil and reduce the heat so it is just simmering and cover. This is where you need to be careful, different varieties of rice will take different times to cook, even the same brand across batches can differ slightly. You need to wait until the rice is partially cooked through, but the outer layer has not burst, which causes the stickiness. You can tell this by breaking the rice apart with your thumbnail, if a tiny white spot is present in the middle, it is perfect. If you can easily squash the rice between your thumb and forefinger, you have gone too far. You could cheat by adding a little turmeric or food colouring to the water before adding the rice, you can then tell how much stock has been absorbed into the rice by how far the colour has penetrated inside.</li>\n<li>One the rice has reached this point, drain immediately, and it is important that you work quickly here as the rice is still cooking. In a pre-prepared pot with some oil or ghee smeared on the inside, add a small layer of rice on the bottom, but do not push down. Add your meat and or vegetables etc, and repeat with more rice until all your ingredients are used. Finally, cover the pan with some tinfoil (dough or dum was traditionally used), place a lid on top and ensure there are no gaps to let the steam escape, and place on the lowest heat possible for 30 minutes. The rice will continue to steam, and will absorb the juices from the meat etc. Take off the heat, empty onto a large wide plate to prevent the rice continuing to cook.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The critical part is point 3. How long will this take? It all depends on many factors, your variety of rice, how high your burner is, how freely the rice can move in the stock when cooking etc. I try to use 4-5 times the volume of stock to rice, but this allows the rice plenty of room to expand and any excess starch to go into the water rather than stick to the rice.</p>\n<p>Using this method, I've not had a sticky, flavourless biryani yet. Provided the rice is not too raw at step 3, you can always err on the side of caution and add it to the pot a bit harder than you think is right, you can always steam it for longer with the foil on provided the meat or vegetables have sufficient liquid to generate some steam.</p>\n",

Anecdotally, I have a good friend who is really put off by, what he calls, the &quot;sulfur&quot; smell of egg when cooked traditionally.  However, he finds eggs cooked a low temperatures (sous vide) acceptable.  So, I'm guessing that this is a personal sensitivity or aversion, rather than the incubation of bacteria. You might try sous vide/low temperature eggs to see if it makes a difference for you. I, admittedly, don't know of any evidence that demonstrates why there would be a difference for him based on cooking technique....but, that is his experience.  N=1, but might help you get a handle on things...or someone in the gustatory or olfaction business can weigh in and set us straight.  My point is that you don't simply need to stop your investigation and decide to avoid eggs.  Try some alternate preparations to see if that has an impact on your perception.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>I am afraid this is the question to which you are unlikely to ever discover the answer.</p>\n<p>It is completely normal that you can smell some molecule that others cannot smell. When somebody smells an egg, several hundred compounds (of the thousands or more present in the egg) dock to receptors in their nose, and the combination of the information of these receptors, plus all other information available to the brain (including seeing an egg, being in a kitchen, etc.) leads to the recognition of an egg. And the set of receptors one has is pretty much unique to them. So, for everybody, there is a different subset of compounds their nose detects when they are around an egg.</p>\n<p>It so happens, that in an egg-eating culture, pretty much all of these compounds have a positive association. I may smell A, B and C and think &quot;oh, egg, tasty!&quot; and my neighbour might smell A, B and D and think &quot;oh, egg, tasty!&quot;. But apparently, you have a rare case where you smell A, B and Z, and for some reason, Z is very unpleasant.</p>\n<p>In the current situation, it is highly unlikely that this comes from a microorganism. Such an explanation is both unnecessarily complex, and, as you already noted, it doesn't give the microorganism time to multiply. It is probably a chemical thing where either something that was bound up in other molecules gets released in certain preparations, or a chemical reaction happens during the preparation and a new compound gets created. (And if it was, against all odds, a microorganism, it is obviously not a safety-relevant one: people would have noticed if these egg preparations were causing food poisoning left and right, even if they couldn't smell it).</p>\n<p>So, the situation is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are myriads of chemical reactions happening when you prepare an egg</li>\n<li>one of them has a product which you can smell and is very unpleasant</li>\n<li>the ability to smell this is really rare (else it would be common knowledge that there is a subpopulation of people who hate eggs prepared this way).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finding out which exact chemical docks onto your receptors would be a multi-year task for a team of scientists with access to highly specialized equipment, involving regular experimentations with you as the subject. And if somebody did do it, then... all you have is a molecule's name. If preparing the eggs in a certain way releases that molecule, it will continue to get released. It is unlikely that you can do anything about it, short of selectively breeding a new race of hens whose eggs don't contain that compound, something that would take decades, if possible at all.</p>\n<p>So, the most realistic thing you can do is to accept that you just hate that smell. In the grand scheme of variations one's genes can encode, that one idiosyncrasy is pretty compatible with a happy life - just stay away from eggs prepared in ways you dislike :)</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>This is one of the reasons why soups with finely cut vegetables are considered a more refined/better crafted dish than those with larger lumps. I am not saying that it is somehow morally wrong to cook and eat soups with large and/or irregular chunks of stuff, but if you make that decision, you are automatically making tradeoffs. And one of them is that your &quot;fair dispensing&quot; becomes much less attainable.</p>\n<p>In the ideal case, you will have cut all pieces small enough such that there will be several of each kind per spoon (this is good not only for distribution, but also to provide a consistent taste with every spoonful). Then the only inhomogeneity will be between the solid pieces and the soup liquid.</p>\n<p>In that case, the way to distribute it is such: First, you make sure that the pot is stirred well, and that it is no longer actively boiling. Then you take your ladle and grab some soup from the very bottom of the pot, even slightly scraping it. You place one or two ladles into the bowl that way. You gauge whether you have reached your desired level of solids, and if more are needed, grab just a little bit of solids with the next scoop. After that, you continue filling the bowl from the top, which means you are scooping liquid only, or very nearly so. At the end, you place any decoration on the surface of the soup in the bowl.</p>\n<p>If your starting situation is not as ideal, you work the same way, but accept that you will also achieve less fairness - and in egregious cases, you have to adjust by fishing single items out of the bowl or the pot. It costs time indeed, but there is nothing to be done about that.</p>\n<p>I don't know for sure how this would work with long noodles, as I have never put those into soup (in fact, all noodles I have seen sold as soup noodles are short). But it is a reasonably good way to work with soup made with vegetables, meat, and small noodles.</p>\n<p>There are some kinds of soup which have some huge chunks (such as large Maultaschen, or golfball-sized meatballs). These recipes tend to not have much small-cut vegetables and other stuff floating around. In that case, you can count out the desired number of chunks with a slotted spoon, then use a ladle to fill up the bowl with liquid.</p>\n",

The best way to resolve this ambiguity is to find a recipe that is more specific.

Bread doughs and pasta doughs, when compared to other doughs, are strong in the sense that they are not crumbly, but very cohesive.</p>\n<p>Within the spectrum of bread dough, a strong dough is a dough that feels like play-doh. Right after kneading, it sticks little or not at all, it is elastic (wants to return to its original shape after deformation), and when it rises, it is capable of trapping lots of gas.</p>\n<p>This is caused by the internal structure of the dough. It is held together by an elastic mesh of a protein called gluten, and when bakers say &quot;strong dough&quot; they mean a dough in which the gluten mesh is stronger than in the weak dough. The mesh is denser and holds together better.</p>\n<p>The way kneading (including stretch and fold) makes dough stronger is by creating gluten. Flour contains the precursors of gluten, glutenin and gliadin; when they meet each other in the presence of water, they stick together. When enough of their molecules stick together, they form the mesh, in which the starch and other dough substances stay embedded. The physical action of the kneading makes these molecules meet each other and stick together, creating the gluten structure.</p>\n<p>The stretch and fold technique is used mostly in very wet bread doughs, where traditional kneading doesn't work well. It creates a better-aligned gluten than traditional kneading, because you are always working in the same direction. But I wouldn't call the stretch-and-folded dough stronger than traditionally kneaded dough.</p>\n",

While this stretching might help further develop the gluten a little bit, the main purpose is to gently deflate the dough a bit, and to move the dough around so that the yeast cells are redistributed and get access to fresh food, leading to a strong second rising.</p>\n<p>After the dough has risen and you're ready to shape it into a loaf, you follow a similar process of stretching the dough out a bit and rolling or folding it in on itself.

Those will then interact with the yeast and produce gas, which is trapped by the gluten walls, producing the magic that is bread.

Once the dough comes together again in the mixer, which normally involves some resting, I stop it and let it rest. Then I stretch and folding every half hour or so until bedtime (a variable number of times depending on when I started).

Cutting up a chicken into pieces is jointing, removing the meat from the bones entirely is boning, it sounds like you were jointing the chicken to me. Either knife will do the job, it's partly down to personal preference and what you have to hand. I've found that knowing where to cut is far more important than what you use to do it, and I've used used virtually every type of knife to joint chicken one time or another.</p>\n<p>I've found that the flexibility of a boning knife is not helpful for many tasks, and between the two I would use a paring knife for boning as it's more direct. In my own kitchen I would use neither, instead I would reach for my 12cm (4.5in) utility knife, which is a slightly scaled up paring knife, it has more reach but it's still easy to handle. Boning knives are great for boning fish, but really not that much else.</p>\n",

It's just the thinnest piece of bone you'll ever see, but it's razor sharp, and I worry that it could do real damage in the bellies of my three little kids.

This means that you have to have developed your gluten well enough during the kneading stages, and that with the second knockback, you should have brought it back to at least somewhat elastic stage, it shouldn't be too sloppy.</p>\n<p>When you have this, be sure that you have enough flour. &quot;Sprinkle&quot; is a bad word in this context; you want your counter to be covered with an even layer of flour at least 0.5 mm thick <em>after</em> the rolling. As Unlisted said, you will have to add flour during the rolling process.</p>\n<p>The upper surface also needs sufficient flouring; if it didn't get enough during rolling, you can sprinkle some on top (this time actually sprinkle) and disperse it with your flat hand. This will take care of the &quot;sticks to itself&quot; part.</p>\n<p>The pizza thickness is also important, start with thicker pizzas (about 1 cm) and only work down as your skill increases with experience.</p>\n<p>When you have your nice, round, rolled 1-cm disc laying comfortably in a bed of flour, you should place the oiled pan close enough, pick it up between your thumbs and forefingers, and drape it onto the pan. I tend to pick it up at 10 and 2 o'clock, and use an initial contact point at 6 o'clock, laying it gently towards 12 o'clock.</p>\n<p>If the dough is larger than the pan or has protrusions, make sure that the extra portions stay caught on the rim, and don't fall onto the dough in the pan. Then, after all the dough is on the pan, you can start picking up corners of the pizza close to the rim and allowing them to gently lay down towards the place where the pan wall meets the pan bottom, and either make a rolled crust or cut the dough off.</p>\n<p>If later you are aiming at very large pans or very thin pizzas, it is worth considering the strudel method, where you use a thin rolling pin and roll the dough around it for transfer. But that won't work well with a pizza above 5 mm in thickness and/or around 30 cm in diameter.</p>\n",

When I first started making pizzas I was surprised by how much flour I had to use to keep it from sticking. Scatter a <strong>thick</strong> layer on, and if it starts to stick peel it up and put more before it really adheres.</p>\n<p>As for moving it to the pan you use the same technique as for pastry which is rolling it around your rolling pin and then unrolling it on the pan. You could also slide the pan under, but not if it's an oiled pan. Personally I prefer to use semolina or coarse corn meal instead of oil, the grains act as miniature ball bearings and give the bottom a nice crunch.</p>\n<p>Reading your post it does sound like your dough may be a bit fragile, make sure you are using bread flour with a high gluten content to get the strongest crust.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>There are a few things you can do. Generally speaking, sticky dough does come out nice and delicious at the cost of being able to handle it well. You either practice handling more sticky dough by using more flour/oil/semolina and get used to it or lower the hydration level and make it more managable. I recommend the latter.</p>\n<p>As for the very act of transporting the dough from counter top to your pan, there are 2 common options.</p>\n<p><strong>Shape the pizza inside your pan.</strong> This is generally a very good and highly recommended option. For that simply flatten the dough a bit, oil up your pan and proceed to push the dough into the corners of it. If the dough resists fitting into the shape, simply wait 5 minutes and continue shaping. The dough will relax and be more managable. The oil still crisps it up nicely giving you a decent crust. If you added to little dough into the pan then simply don't bother to stretching it to fit your pan.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a pizza peel or equivilant</strong> If you already flattend the dough on a generously floured counter, it does not have enough structual integrity to survive being pulled and held up in a rough manner. Especially if the toppings are already on it. Simply take a pizza peel and with one confident and fast move slide it underneath and transport it wherever you want. You can also use cardboard or anything thin and big enough. This relies on you having floured your countertop veeeeerrry generously when working sticky doughs.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>There seems to be a lot of confusion here, including people who use <em>pans</em> for pizza. While deep dish pizza is a thing (and can be very good!), I believe that the OP want to make something closer to Neapolitan pizza, where the pizza goes straight onto the (stone or metal) bottom of the oven (or pizza stone).</p>\n<p>Nathan Myhrvold, in his seminal 'Modernist Pizza' has a couple of thought on this. One key idea is to use a <em>lot</em> of flour (or even better, semolina) on the work surface, the first couple of times. Another is to use a slotted pizza peel, which makes (some) of this extra flour come off, when you pick up the pizza. The most important aspect, however, is to work fast! Once you have spread out the dough, you should be quick. If possible, put it in the oven (on a pizza stone, or in a real pizza oven) within 30 seconds. This takes some practice, but if you have all your topping ingredients ready it's possible.\nYou can also build your pizza <em>on the peel</em>, but that works less well on a slotted peel, as it can get stuck.</p>\n<p>Another cheaty trick is to build the pizza on baking parchment. You don't get quite the same crunchy base, but it's much easier!</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>I believe you have answered your own question in the second sentence, &quot;I can't do anything good without a recipe&quot;. While a proportion of cooking is about technique, the best &quot;Natural&quot; chefs don't follow a recipe as they understand the basic principles of what tastes good, and how to get there. Having a recipe more often than not can get in the way, as you spend so much time focusing on it you lose sight of the goal.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is subjectivity, what person A considers delicious, person B might consider disgusting. So the first question you need to ask yourself is &quot;Who am I really cooking for&quot;? If it is just you, it will be a lot simpler, as you know what you like and you will no doubt be your own worse critic. If it is for family and friends, you will need to hone your skills a bit further, as people will not always be honest not wanting to offend and will say &quot;I enjoyed that&quot; purely out of politeness, which will not help you improve.</p>\n<p>I believe everyone is capable of cooking to a high standard and it is just a matter of grasping the three S's - Safety, Sensation and Satisfaction. First of all, is the food well cooked and not pose a health risk? Secondly, does it taste good? Finally, is there sufficient ingredients to turn a hungry diner into a fulfilled one? If you have sufficient interest and passion, these skills are not difficult to achieve.</p>\n<p>Certainly, understanding all of these factors well will take time and experience. Depending on how passionate you are about cooking, how adventurous you want to be, these factors will all dictate the pace. So this is what I would recommend:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Forget about recipes, as a beginner, you need to grasp the basic techniques, and YouTube is an excellent resource for this. Find a cuisine you like, find a chef whose style you like, and watch 20-30 of their videos. While you are watching, ask yourself one question - &quot;Why&quot;? If they don't explain as part of the video, this forum will give you the answers, or better still, find a chef who explains the reasoning behind their technique. Personally, I'd recommend Chef John at Food Wishes, but he may not cover the specific genre you want to cook. Another good chef to learn from is Jamie Oliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don't run before you can walk. Learn the most basic dishes, omelette, cooked chicken breast, rice etc. Many professional chefs judge a cook by how well these simple dishes are cooked, as it is easy to get them so wrong. A good lesson is learning how to cook a pale French omelette, pale on the outside but perfectly cooked on the inside. This will teach you about the importance of controlling heat during cooking, and also how food continues to cook with residual heat.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ensure you have the basic tools to make your job easier. I'd recommend a food thermometer, as it will take the guesswork out of food safety when it comes to cooked meat etc. As far as food storage is concerned, read up on the guidelines, the 2 hour rule etc. Personally, I won't keep leftovers more than 48 hours in the fridge, but everyone is different. Plan ahead, any leftovers should be rapidly chilled and/or frozen. Try to ensure you use all perishable ingredients across different meals, e.g. if you cook a whole chicken use the remainder in a salad or use it in a pie.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Realise you will make mistakes, but at the same time cooking is very much down to confidence. Provided your dish is safe to eat, the worse outcome is that it won't taste that good. Try and work out why, and learn from your mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Once you can cook a basic meal well and confidently (say chicken omelette, chips and veg) <strong>then</strong> start reading up and following recipes, starting with the most straightforward and as your confidence builds, move on.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If really feel you must have the recipe to guide you, get yourself an entry level cookbook, Delia Smith would be a good start. If her cuisine doesn't appeal, think of a dish a friend has cooked you enjoy, and ask them for the recipe and also offer to help them next time they cook provided they show you how. Not only will they appreciate the help, they will be happy to share their wisdom. Don't forget to ask &quot;Why&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To get where you want to be will take time, there are no short-cuts or easy routes. Part of the start of your success will be achieved by taking the pressure off yourself, not everyone is a natural whizz in the kitchen and it is part learned, part intuitive. If you are passionate and are willing to put the time in away from the stove, I'm sure you will achieve it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

Then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't just pick one cuisine, unless that's all you'll enjoy eating - sampling a variety will demonstrate how simple base ingredients work to make very different dishes.</li>\n<li>Learn some classic, not-too-complex dishes, as they form a reference point (I don't mean memorise - it's fine to look up the proportions each time).  From a European point of view, this could include things like omelettes, roux-based sauces, and some simple tomato-based sauces for pasta.</li>\n<li>Concentrate on cooking when you have time.  Rather than rushing through a recipe every evening, cook enough to freeze (or chill for a few days) leftovers when you're making something appropriate.  Then when you do cook you can do so patiently.  You can taste more often, and think about what's going on.</li>\n<li>The key is to experiment.

                "body": "<p>It's not just you. I've used online recipes since before the Internet was publicly available, through very old mailing lists and BBSses back in the fog of time, and my experience was always like yours - I would cook those (or obv. from old-fashioned books) and it was almost hit &amp; miss. Even if I did everything just perfectly fine, many recipes just weren't that great. I assume that's because cooking just is a very varying thing. Your ingredients will be of varying taste and quality; measurements are usually relatively vague (especially if you're working by volume, not weight), and so on.</p>\n<p>Presumably, even if a recipe works great for the person creating it, or for a percentage of people following it, it's either random chance, or because they correct for those variables intuitively.</p>\n<p>For me, I can trace my intuitive cooking back to a few very specific basic &quot;discoveries&quot;, or very basic recipes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying a wok was awesome, as it lets you experiment very easily. A very basic method is this:\n** Pick some easy meat, i.e. chicken, cut into bite-size pieceses. Start with that, and roast it in the wok until brown on the outside, and white on the inside. Then push it up the wok to stay warm.</li>\n<li>Throw in some amount of rice that seems about right, and cook that a little bit in the residual oil from the meat, until it smells nutty.</li>\n<li>Throw in water (twice the amount of the rice, by volume), and add spices (salt and whatever else you want), maybe some squirts of tomato concentrate (as spice, not as main ingredient), maybe a pinch of sugar, a few drops of lime juice. The spices I mentioned can go into a surprisingly large amount of foods, certainly in most soup/rice-like ones.</li>\n<li>Push the meat into the mess, and let all of it cook until the water has been taken up by the rice and/or evaporated, and everything seems to have good mouth texture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A recipe like this is vague enough to force you to understand what the individual bits &amp; pieces are doing, and to give you enough freedom to experiment. Do that! Just look at your kitchen and throw in whatever is not obviously wrong. Experiment with sharp, sour, sweet tasting condiments.</p>\n<p>A second great avenue are salads. A very very basic recipe is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A head of green salad, cut into small ribbons per taste.</li>\n<li>Tomatoes, sliced&amp;diced, as much as you want.</li>\n<li>Olives (I love black olives), cut 2-3 times per olive, as much as you want.</li>\n<li>Salt</li>\n<li>Pepper</li>\n<li>Balsamic Vinegar (look for the label &quot;Modena&quot; if that's available for you)</li>\n<li>Olive Oil</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just throw all of that in a big bowl in this order (no need to mix up the spices/fluids before) and mix it very well.</p>\n<p>Then cook any kind of meat you like (i.e., a big rump steak, a few chicken legs, or whatever else you are comfortable with). If it's not finger food anyways (i.e. chicken legs), dice the meat and throw it onto the salad. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>The third is soups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Throw some diced bacon into a big pot and brown it on all sides. It is fine if it leaves a dark residue on the floor.</li>\n<li>Slice an onion and cook it until it's brown/glassy (reduce heat to avoid burning it; this can take 10 minutes).</li>\n<li>Slice &amp; dice whatever veggies you like (cauliflower is great for me; but also peppers or leek; I also love having really a <em>lot</em> of onion in the first step), and throw all of those in one after the other, get a bit of heat into all of them. No specific timing required.</li>\n<li>Add salt, pepper, optionally something hot, optionally garlic powder (or actual garlic), and/or all other kinds of spices you can imagine. A pinch of sugar, few drops of lime juice, any and all mediterranean spices, any and all Mexican spices... knock yourself out!</li>\n<li>Add a good amount of heavy cream and maybe a bit of water to achieve a consistency you like, to just cover the whole amount of veggies.</li>\n<li>Add a good amount of cheese (Gouda etc.) that dissolves easily.</li>\n<li>Let all of it stew for 20-30 minutes with lid on and very low heat (very slight bubbling, no all-out boiling).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, this is a base recipe which is intentionally vague, but each step means something; i.e. you're layering tastes and ingredients. It invites you to vary. You can for example use tomato juice instead or on top of the heavy cream. Nothing in it should be hard or even possible to mess up.</p>\n<p>While cooking, try to imagine how the tastes and smells react to each other. Obviously for these recipes there are some ingredients that do not fit well (don't throw in any Nutella :) ). By starting with easy, not critical recipes, you get confidence, and by varying everything (ingredients, heat, time, etc.) you get experience.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you can just throw stuff together seemingly at random, and it always tastes acceptable at least, if not great!</p>\n",

            "body": "<p>I went to do the bulk ferment on my cranberry walnut sourdough last night and because the house was a bit cooler than normal I decided to give the temps a little boost by turning on the oven for a bit (usually 3-5 minutes before turning it off) so that the right rear burner will then be nice and warm for a while.\nWell then I got distracted by a movie I was watching (can't count the number of times that's led to some kind of cooking fail, lol), and at least 30 minutes must have passed before I realized what happened. I ran and yanked it off the stove, felt the bottom which was quite hot, started filling the sink with cold water and took a couple of readings with my infrared gun - the bottom was 129 \u00b0F (59 \u00b0C) while the top of the dough was about 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C) and then plunged the container into the cold water for about 5 minutes.\nI then dumped it onto the counter, it looked fairly flat and the interior was still quite warm so I immediately started folding until the overall temp was uniform (about 112 \u00b0F/44 \u00b0C) put it in a bin and stuck it in the fridge.  It doesn't look TOO bad this morning seems like there's some life, but now I'm thinking about adding in a fresh batch of starter and take it from there. SOOOO, anyone else ever managed to save a batch under similar circumstances?\n;?)</p>\n",

But most of the cheaper stuff you can buy is not made that way.</p>\n<p>When you buy a very tasty fruity vinegar, it is usually just a mixture of actual vinegar and fruit syrup. Sometimes also fruit juice, if you want to keep more of the sour taste. This is very easy to achieve - just get some fruit syrup or juice, maybe adding some other sweetener like beet syrup, and add some to the vinegar. Work on some  minimal test batches first, and start with very low concentrations, until you know your preferred mixture - you don't want to make it too sweet all at once.</p>\n<p>If you want to try aging, you don't have to buy an actual barrel. Even in industry, it is common practice to use wood chips inside of nonreactive vessels - and you can dose the chips for any batch size. Just make sure you get untreated wood.</p>\n<p>An alternative way to infuse taste, combining both of the above, is to take ripe fruit, cover it in vinegar, and let it stay for a couple of weeks.

                "body": "<p>So gummy bears are typically made with gelatin. At high enough concentrations, it will not melt at room temperature, and is quite bouncy.</p>\n<p>I would buy unflavored gelatin, and make a batch with four times the recommended amount and see how that works for you. That concentration will likely get a little soft, but will not melt at room temperature. If you still need it firmer, add more gelatin. If it's too firm, add less. Unfortunately, I can't know exactly what texture you want.</p>\n<p>If you want it to be even more stretchy and rubbery, then look into making gummy candy.    I've used a recipe from Sugar Geek Show that's made in a microwave, and it's quite simple. The issue I had with it was with air bubbles in the mixture, but I'm guessing this could be prevented by using gelatin sheets and a stove top method instead. I also reduced the amount of liquid for an even chewier texture. That said the ingredient proportions worked really well for me. To summarize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50 g water</li>\n<li>50 g granulated sugar</li>\n<li>21 g gelatin</li>\n<li>71g flavored liquid like juice (I reduced this to 20g safely)</li>\n<li>85 g corn syrup (or honey)</li>\n<li>1/4 tsp citric acid powder (optional)</li>\n<li>1-2 drops candy flavoring (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Combine the water, sugar, gelatin, and flavored liquid in a pint measuring cup, and give the gelatin 5 minutes or so to bloom. Then microwave for 30 seconds at a time and stir gently until completely melted, then add the corn syrup/honey and other ingredients if using. You should have about 1 cup of gummy candy goo. Then you can pour the hot mixture into your molds and let it set. Pry the gummy candies out of their molds and allow to dry at room temperature for a few days if desired, flipping occasionally. They will shrink a bit if you allow them to dry, but this will give them an even chewier texture.</p>\n<p>Using plant-based gums or cooked starch could also provide you with a gel, but I think gelatin might be the easiest way to go.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>When buying lump charcoal (which is my preference) I've found that the brand is really important.  Some of these producers are sourcing their wood from worksites or other potentially contaminated locations.  Keep an eye out for dimensional lumber, for example.  You probably don't want charcoal made from pressure treated lumber.  But it can get far worse: PVC, metals, and other debris can find it's way into the bag.</p>\n<p>In my preferred brand, I have found an occasional rock.  Generally, they are roughly the size and shape of a piece of charcoal.  While I'm annoyed to pay charcoal prices for a rock that I don't need or want, the quality of the rest of the charcoal is very good.  This leads me to think that this is not intentional but just part of ramping up production.  I don't think people are looking at every log or stick that's going into the 'cook'.  They are probably scoping up wood with a front loader or some sort of large claw and some rocks are picked up inadvertently.</p>\n<p>I would keep an eye out for things like plastic but a few rocks are part of the cost of using lump charcoal, IMO.  If you are getting a lot of contaminants in your charcoal, look for another brand.  Where I live, the smaller hardware stores and butcher shops have the good stuff.</p>\n",

The variation you see -- some managing to stay together, others cracking -- is likely due to things subtly affecting the cohesion, such as the distribution of sesame seeds. So I wouldn't suggest trying to determine why the effect is intermittent... it's balanced on a knife edge, and sometimes it falls off the wrong side.</p>\n<p>Using more chickpea flour and less fava beans might help. Grinding the fava beans more finely might help. Adding some wheat flour might help. Basically, anything you can do to promote cohesion. Additionally, reducing the baking soda might help, but it's not the first thing I'd try.</p>\n<p>In a comment, Joe makes a really good point that the shape determines how much strain the expansion/contraction causes. A sphere is already at minimal surface area, so expansion <em>has</em> to involve cracking. But a smooshed sphere (or disc) can bow outward instead, flexing instead of rupturing.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>I don't know if you'll be able to salvage this soup, but I will tell you how you can try. The reason your soup tastes unpleasant is that you added a raw flour slurry. Adding raw flour gives a raw flour flavor which is unpleasant as you've found. In small quantities you may not notice it, but if you add a lot it can ruin a dish. If it is very strong now it may still be too strong after you thin the soup out.</p>\n<p>The only way to thin the soup is to dilute the soup with fresh milk and/or stock. What I would try is to remove half the liquid (strain out the solids and put them back in) and replace it with fresh liquid and add some herbs and spices to replace those flavors. The reasons for removing half the liquid as opposed to adding more to the whole soup are 1) to keep it in balance with the solid ingredients and 2) to minimize waste: if it doesn't work you're either throwing out double or if you decide to eat it you have twice the unpalatable soup to eat. Bring it up to temperature and try it, it may need more seasoning. Try some white pepper, it's good in chowder and may help to disguise any remaining raw flour flavor. That's as far as I would personally go, if you end up with something edible I'd stop before you go overboard and make it worse.</p>\n<p>There are 2 main ways of thickening a soup, one is to use a slurry as you did. Slurries are quick and convenient, if you want to use a slurry use cornstarch (corn flour) or potato starch instead, they will thicken without adding flavor. The second method is to make a roux, which is equal amounts by weight of flour and butter cooked in a pan. The benefit of a roux is it cooks the rawness out of the flour and adds flavor. The longer you cook it the darker it gets, the more flavor it adds but it reduces its thickening power. For my milk based chowders I make a light roux, cooking it just a minute or two as I like the depth of flavor it gives. However, there's nothing wrong with a cornstarch slurry if that's what you have the time and inclination to do, a roux is just extra credit. If time is a factor you can make a roux ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator.</p>\n<p>Another problem you ran into was that in a slow cooker it can take a long time to see the results after adding thickener, this is because slow cooker temperatures are low and flour/cornstarch don't fully thicken until the temperature reaches 203\u00b0F/95\u00b0C, although they start to thicken at a lower temperature. You have to know how much thickener to add, or you add it and then wait a long time to see the result. You could also use a lower temperature thickening agent like tapioca starch or arrowroot and see the result sooner.</p>\n",

Industrially, it is possible to produce shelf-stable yogurt-derived products, such as yogurt powder, but not completely shelf-stable yogurt.</p>\n<p>To get a misconception out of the way: canned food is not canned only because it is sealed; in fact, your yogurt <em>is</em> probably sealed in the sense that there are no new microorganisms entering the jar after you have closed it. You don't actually need the strong vacuum of properly canned food to avoid this, that vacuum is more of a safety margin, and a marker of fermentation activity.</p>\n<p>For preserving canned food, you need the full combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a food that is capable of being preserved by canning. This applies to most fruits and vegetables, and, with some methods, meat.</li>\n<li>a packaging which prevents contact of the ambient atmosphere with the food</li>\n<li>a method for creating a temperature high enough to kill off whatever microorganisms may be present.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For <em>all dairy</em>, you are already outside of any possibility of home canning. There are no methods which can give you canned dairy, no matter how well you secure your packaging against air ingress.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I kept the answer of the literal question for the end, because it is likely to be uninteresting. But in principle, yes, you can seal yogurt which you are making in canning containers. I am skeptical that this will work with the screw-top jars common in Europe, but it works for certain for the old style weck jars with glass lids with separate rubber gaskets, and possibly with mason-style jars where the screw threads are not built into the actual lid.</p>\n<p>To seal one of these glasses without heat, you have to place it into a larger container with a small hole in the lid, and use a home vacuuming device to create a vacuum in the outer container. This will also create a vacuum in the inner container, strong enough to seal it airtight. It is a neat trick to use with things like spices, to prolong their freshness. But it is not a preservation technique.</p>\n",

The resultant frozen food would have a rough surface and potentially sharp edges.

This factoid has no practical use for cooking, but it may help you clarify your concepts - your phrases &quot;remains liquid&quot; and &quot;thickness is maximized&quot; actually point to a state of matter which is probably not the one you wanted to achieve.</p>\n",

Pure cream and egg custards may not take kindly to an extra freeze-thaw cycle.</p>\n<p>The issue you may get is getting your flavors mixed in a cold base. Chocolate will solidify at that temperature, so if you are adding chocolate you'll either have to re-heat the base to mix it in, or add some oil to the chocolate once it is melted to keep it from solidifying. Coffee, mint extract and other liquid flavorings should mix in fine, as should Nutella, although you'll need to use a stick blender to get it incorporated. Real mint ice cream needs the mint leaves to be steeped in a hot base to extract the flavor.</p>\n<p>Re-heating the base shouldn't be a problem, just make sure you build in the time to chill it again. For me going through the steps to re-heat and cool the base again would defeat the purpose of what you are trying to achieve, so it would be best to stick to flavorings you can mix in cold.</p>\n",

I use homemade marshmallows on top that are always very soft when cutting and very sticky, however I have noticed when I put them on top of the cookie and bake them they turn a nice golden color but get very... crunchy? They lose their marshmallow quality and have the texture almost resembling honeycomb. When I use storebought marshmallows, however, the marshmallows turn nice and golden and remain gooey inside, but I like the taste of homemade marshmallows better and prefer them. Is there a way to prevent them from going crunchy while baking but still have that golden color?\nThe cookies are being baked at 350 for 11 minutes. The marshmallows have no egg or corn syrup.</p>\n",

With experimentation, you might be able to find out the exact time they need when they are already melted, but not yet caramelized. Hint: for this kind of experiment, you don't need to bake the whole cookies, you can try a series of baked marshmallows on a silicone mat, to systematically find your perfect baking time.</p>\n<p>If this doesn't work out, then your marshmallows are unsuitable for melting. Then you are left with the second option, which is to try out different recipes, until you find one that melts well. Look for recipes with higher liquid content than your current one -  but note that for any liquid that goes into the syrup part of the candy making process, it is not the initial amount that counts, but the final temperature at which you use it.</p>\n",

Even with a recipe I'd be guessing what the consistency would be, so I'll give you my approach instead. Grab a small amount of the mix and roll it into a ball. If it keeps its shape and is relatively firm then you're good to go, if it sags or falls apart it's not going to hold together. You can also make a little ball and microwave it for 30 seconds and see whether it holds together when cooked. I use this method to test for seasoning with meatballs and mealoaves (meatloafs? meatlofii? No idea as to the plural here), and to check the consistency.</p>\n<p>If your mix doesn't hold together well enough then you have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add more binder: more breadcrumbs will bring it all back together, but if it's really loose you may have to add so much it will make the result bready, which isn't desirable</li>\n<li>Cook it up and serve it over a starch such as rice, mashed potatoes or pasta, depending on the flavoring. You could also make a shepherds pie or cottage pie with it. Or, as @A_SOO suggests, you could make sloppy joes</li>\n</ol>\n",

These cookers do have an underpressure after cooling which you manually relieve before opening (it's plain impossible to move the lid unless you do that). Either with a lever pushing the rubber sealing or by twisting/screwing the valve into an &quot;all directions open&quot; position.

As you already mentioned you can freeze it. If this works and you dont have enough bottles maybe the easiest way would be to get more squeeze bottles.</p>\n<p>Regarding canning the dressing: Maybe just give it a try. If you already have the dressing you might as well just take a canning jar, process it in the canner and see if it works. Best case is that it works and that you have a perfectly canned glass of dressing. Worst case is that you lose a glass of dressing and a bit of time.</p>\n<p>Depending on how much dressing your father eats you could also put it in sterilized containers using a sterilized funnel, close the containers carefully without heating the content, and store the containers in the back of the fridge where it is the coldest.

I'm with you - I think the fridge is too cold since it kills the taste a bit and I don't want to wait for it to warm up, so a specialized cooler made a huge difference to me. You can set the ideal temp away from a kitchen fridge but out of the too-warm house atmosphere.</p>\n<p>What the others said was correct, of course - you can use a kitchen fridge or do whatever works for you because ultimately a &quot;proper&quot; way doesn't exist since it's so subjective.</p>\n",

In a hot environment, the average cooler box may not even reach fridge temperature, but something that gets closer to the recommended drinking temperature for red wine. If you happen to have a thermometer (the meat thermometer sold by a major European furniture outlet for less than \u20ac 10 should work well for this), you can even monitor the temperature.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you can always fill a large vessel (preferably a well-insulated one) with cold tap water and place the bottle in there, which should also get the wine close to the recommended serving temperature.

However, if you KEEP your reds in your fridge, they will eventually get below room temperature (or whatever temperature range you prefer for them), and you may have to take them out for a few hours to get UP to the right temperature. (btw, if you want to have some fun with your friends, cool a red down the temperature for white wines and conduct a blindfolded tasting with them. I bet half or more won't identify the wine as a red!)</p>\n<p>If you really want to cool your wines to a precisely controlled temperature, use an immersion circulator (the kind you use for <em>sous vide</em>) and a water bath. The problem though is that it will take a long time (glass is a terrible conductor of heat) and most likely the label will come off by the time the contents of the bottle come to temperature. The upside though is you'll get to really blow your friends' minds with the extreme lengths you're willing to go to serve them wine at the &quot;right&quot; temperature! ;-)</p>\n",

If you have something that is vulnerable to bacterial growth (not everything is, which is why we can safely store many non-canned foods between 41F and 135F) then the higher the temperature the bigger the problem.

Harold McGee (1990) clarifies this in his excellent book, The Curious Cook.&quot;  He writes, &quot;if the mix contains little sugar, most of the water freezes into large crystals...and the texture of the ice is hard and crumbly. If the original mix contains a lot of sugar...more syrup remains unfrozen, and the ice crystals are relatively small.  The fruit ice ends up soft and smooth.&quot;  His chapter on fruit ices breaks this down and explains it comprehensively.  He identifies four types of ices, and provides tables for calculating the proportions of fruit juice, water, sugar, and (in many cases) a little lemon, for each.  What he calls a &quot;sweet water ice or fruit ice&quot; is probably close to what you are calling a slush.  It has enough sugar to remain soft in the freezer, but it is pretty intensely flavored.  In this case you are looking at 30 - 35% sugar.  The amount of sugar added depends on the type of fruit, thus the tables he provides.  If that is too sweet, you can make what he calls a &quot;medium sweet fruit ice&quot;, at about 20% sugar, but it will solidify in the freezer and you will need to allow it to thaw a bit to achieve an enjoyable texture.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that the amount of sugar is absolutely related to the final texture of your fruit ice.</p>\n",

A bulging can is a sign of some fermentation or growth inside the can after processing. As canning is supposed to (essentially) kill everything so nothing will grow, that is a sign of a something wrong, and the something wrong could be benign but could easily be dangerous (e.g., botulism) and since canning is normally very effective the safe thing to do is <em>throw it out</em>.</p>\n<p>But a dent is not the same thing. Most <em>dents</em> even in cans in the store are simply because somebody dropped a can on a hard surface (e.g., top shelf down to floor) and unless there is indication of penetration of the exterior (e.g., moisture, rust, etc.) even an actual dent is not in and of itself a problem. Though to play it safe I would avoid buying dented cans unless those are the only option and I really need that specific product at that time.</p>\n<p>To take a step further, a dent in your own processing - e.g., while opening the can or a known drop at home shortly before opening the can - is not a problem at all.</p>\n<p>Many people are careful to rinse off the top of cans shortly before opening them. That avoids the problem of any outside contaminants (dust, bugs, etc.) getting into the food during the opening process. But that is a separate concern, and even then the concern is not about botulism but about more &quot;ordinary&quot; types of contamination.</p>\n",

Cut implies butchering, and subdividing into pieces, conglomerating is what Macdonald's does when they put a slaughtered chicken in a centrifuge and spin it to separate the meat from the bones and cartilage, and then forms the meat into Mcnuggets. Still a partially amusing image in my head. But back to the original question.</p>\n<p>Cheap usually means conglomerated (see Mcnuggets). That or fish that nobody wants, and is therefore very cheap to begin with. And in the case of fish, I believe the fish heads are considered to be more valuable for making stock, than to try to remove the meat for conglomeration. There could always be exceptions. In Florida for example, grouper cheeks are considered prime meat and command a higher price. If it says 100% fillet, then I would expect it to be illegal to use conglomerated meat, but if they leave out the 100%, it's not a guess as to why.</p>\n<p>Addendum: Just like chicken feet make the best chicken soup, fish heads make the best fish stock. Some Asian restaurants that I frequent make lots of fish stock, and buy fish heads in bulk from the seafood processing plants.</p>\n<p>For ground beef, technically a form of conglomeration, most companies use the cheapest cuts of beef to make them. I have not heard of beef being spun in centrifuges. From what I know, the offal, which is considered to be the parts no one wants to eat, is made into hot dogs. The offal is ground so finely that you can't discern what the original parts were. Then the trimmings and scraps, which are the next step up from offal, are made into the cheapest quality/priced ground beef. There, conglomeration takes on a whole new meaning, as waste from multiple slaughterhouses are combined and ground. I have been told that many frozen burgers are made from that type of conglomeration, and that is why you see gigantic, nationwide recalls if contamination occurs. If your butcher/grocer grinds their own beef, then it will be made from some trimming and scraps, but also better cuts, simply because they can only generate a small percentage of trim and scraps.</p>\n",

You can add this late in the cook.</p>\n<p>I always consider a curry sauce to be a two-stage cook [same with a good chilli].<br />\nYou get your 'bass' from the long cook, your 'treble' from what you add near the end.</p>\n<p>Ground coriander goes in early, as part of your bhuna<sup>[1]</sup>/bhogar<sup>[2]</sup> [wet or dry frying] at the start. If you use tomato puree [by UK definition, the stuff in a squeezy tube] then use a wet-fry bhuna and add the puree late in this stage.  It takes some bitterness out of it. Using a bhuna rather than bhogar makes it harder to burn stuff too - much easier if you're not practised at this.</p>\n<p>Garam masala [basically a blend of aromatics] goes in late. If you can find them, such as ajwan seeds can add a piquancy late, or sprinkled over when serving.</p>\n<p>Fresh coriander goes in right as you serve, or just sprinkled on top. Its flavour starts to dissipate as soon as it's heated. To keep it tasting bright &amp; fresh\u2026 it has to <em>be</em> bright &amp; fresh.</p>\n<p>Some other things can go in both early <em>and</em> late.<br />\nOnions can be in your base sauce, then some newly-fried added ten minutes before serving. Processed tomatoes early, &amp; fresh tomatoes late. The same for fresh chillies, some to cook down into invisibility, some late as a 'brightener'.</p>\n<p>One additional thought\u2026 most people seriously underestimate the amount of oil/fat that goes in a curry. Your sauce base is essentially onion puree &amp; ghee. There's really very little water added. Use ghee if at all possible rather than a cooking oil of any sort. It has a distinct flavour. Even vegetable ghee has that flavour somehow added to it.</p>\n<p><sup>[1]</sup>Basic bhuna method.<br />\nTake all your ground spices &amp; blend to a paste with a little water in a cup - aim for 'tomato ketchup' consistency.<br />\nHeat your ghee. If you have any whole spices, mustard seeds etc, drop them now [this kind of cheats in a quick bhogar without burning anything], then a quick stir &amp; add your bhuna mixture. Fry gently until the water evaporates off &amp; the oil fully blends with the sauce base, then starts to separate out again. Garlic/ginger puree can go in now. Keep it moving all the time to blend &amp; prevent burning. Drop your onion puree &amp; keep this going until your onions clarify. Watch out for it spitting, rather gloopily.<br />\nSalt to taste [but check again later after any other ingredients go in, under-salting will really weaken the flavours].<br />\nThat's your base. Simmer for at least 2 hours.<br />\nAnything else after this point defines your &quot;curry&quot;.</p>\n<p><sup>[2]</sup> The bhogar method is to fry spices directly in hot oil before adding any liquids. This can produce a more intense flavour, but is very easy to burn if not experienced. Bhogar is sometimes called tarka or tadka - I can only assume this is from different language origins, but I'm just a Brit &amp; have no real clue on languages. Same applies to Balti vs Karahi, same thing, different place. Both originally referred to the small wok-like pan it was cooked in, not to what was cooked in it.</p>\n<p>As regards your 'extra, late ingredients'<br />\nPaprika, fine; though there is a similar Northern Indian sub-continent version - Kashmiri Mirch. Similar to paprika in that it adds a lot of colour &amp; flavour without adding any 'heat'. No need to be sparing with it, you can use a tablespoon or more.<br />\nPeri-peri salt - well, again OK as it's another red chilli very similar to bird's eye, though watch the salt levels.<br />\nOregano/thyme - no, not really appropriate.<br />\nCinnamon, clove - absolutely. Keep the quantities low, as each, like cardamom, can be overpowering if not used sparingly.</p>\n<p><em>Late edit\u2026</em><br />\nI only just noticed you have processed tomatoes <strong>and</strong> coconut milk in your recipe. That's an odd combination. Northern dishes would go with the tomatoes, Southern with the coconut. Keralan cuisine would use both, but the tomatoes would be fresh. The rest of your ingredient list would be better suited to a Northern dish, so I'd definitely lose the coconut next time. All of the above methods are 'Northern' methods too. Southern dishes use a lot of dry marinades, again contra to the suggestions above.<br />\nAlso, depending on the 'wetness' of your tomato product, that's overall going to be way too watery. That's why my recipe idea above uses pur\u00e9e, to keep the added water content right down.</p>\n",

            "body": "<p>I have an All Clad stainless steel pot and I was cooking some soup In it. The timer went off to tell me to turn the heat off but I must have been daydreaming because I merely looked at the soup at that point and walked away from it again. Maybe about 15 minutes after that I noticed a strange smell and I realized I had kept the fire burning. There had been only a couple of cups of water to begin with so that was all burned off by now and the noodles were burning at the bottom of the pot.  I was fortunately able to clean about 99% of the residue and debris off of it, thanks to some baking soda, vinegar, salt, and a lot of elbow grease.</p>\n<p>My concern is if I should still use the pot. Most of the Internet tells me it should still be fine and it was only 15 minutes and not an hour or anything. However, I'm a bit concerned because I stupidly had a similar incident a few years ago. At that time, I was boiling a pot of water and left it for 2 hours. (I know, bad). Though I tried to salvage that pot, the steel inside was definitely bubbling and buckling and when I tried to use it a few more times after that, it was making very unsettling, and very loud, snapping noises.  Speaking to All Clad confirmed that the heat that long in the empty pot separated the layers inside (hence the very visible bubbling) and it was time to retire the pot.</p>\n<p>Though this situation is definitely different in that it was only over boiled for 15 minutes and there was still food inside this second pot, and I'm reluctant to throw away an expensive pot and it looks fine (though there\u2019s some discoloration on the outside). However, I'm also reluctant to take a chance if perhaps there has been some similar layer separation inside due to the heat (that might be too slight to see), and if this could cause some danger.</p>\n<p>Thank you for any insight or thoughts!</p>\n",

This also requires some initial chopping, but maybe blending together gets the shallot fine enough for your application.  You may note that there is a flavor difference between grinding and chopping. If you go down the grinding path, you may try to use less at first to balance the flavor.</p>\n<p>If you stick with the fine dice, a super sharp knife will make things easier.

                "body": "<p>The usefulness of the cookbook is going to depend a lot on what you, personally, need from it.</p>\n<p>Take <em>The French Laundry Cook Book</em>; it's got a ton of information in it, but it's mostly organized in separate, specific recipes.  So, for example, the book includes this piece of generally useful information:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chestnut is a luxurious wintertime filling, and a great flavor combination with the Italian Fontina cheese, celery root, and truffle oil</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And on the same page there's a note about how to peel chestnuts, which is also generally useful.  But would you know to look for this note within the recipe for chestnut agnolotti with Fontina and celery root pur\u00e9e?</p>\n<p>There's also the problem of knowing what information is generally useful, and what's only useful for a recipe very similar to this one.  For example, this same chestnut agnolotti includes this note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pass the sauce through a chinois into a large skillet.  You can use the back of a small ladle to help the liquids pass through the strainer, but do not force any solids through.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The instruction to use a ladle, but gently, is actually a useful technique, but because the reasoning is not explained (i.e. it doesn't say <em>why</em> you don't want smashed bits of potato in the finished sauce), this is probably only helpful to a certain kind of reader. If you're following instructions somewhat blindly, you won't know what you can apply elsewhere.  But if you come to this recipe already having a decent idea of what it's trying to achieve, a brief note of instruction might be just enough to teach you when to use this technique.</p>\n<p>For contrast, I'll grab another French cookbook off the shelf: Julia Child's <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>.  This book is far more useful to the novice cook because there's a far higher ratio of explanatory notes to specific recipes.</p>\n<p>A good example is the chapter on vegetables (chapter 8, if you're following along at home).  It begins with an explanation of basic vegetable cooking techniques, and then provides recipes for specific vegetables, many of which use the general techniques just described.</p>\n<p>Look at the beginning of the recipe for braised artichokes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of the many recipes for braised artichoke follow the general lines of this one.  You may, if you wish, add to the casserole a cup of diced tomato...Another suggestion with different vegetables follows this recipe.  Braised artichokes go well with roast or braised meats, or they can constitute a first course.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's a lot of general information in there: most recipes work like this one; you could add these extra ingredients, or this other set of ingredients; this kind of dish is good with these other foods.</p>\n<p>For the experienced cook, this is probably information they don't need.  It's <em>too</em> general.  But for someone who's not confident about cooking artichokes, this is probably significantly more useful than a very precise description of how to make one artichoke dish.</p>\n<p>Both kinds of cookbooks have a lot to teach readers.  Which kind is more useful is a question about you, as much as it is about the book.</p>\n",

I certainly wouldn't use olive oil in curries, but that's mainly because sunflower or rapeseed (canola) oil is cheaper and the olive oil would be wasted.</p>\n<p>Olive oil has its own distinctive flavour, which works well in some foods, but not in others.  This flavour is described as bitter, though not usually bitter enough to be a bad thing in many dishes - after all, extra virgin olive oil can be used alone for dipping bread, though it's common to dip in balsamic vinegar as well, which provides sweetness to offset the bitterness.</p>\n<p>However the tastiest olive oils aren't very good for frying - they're unrefined and burn too easily.  Bitterness can be a result of burning, and with olive oil particularly it seems to come out at the first hint of smoking.  So you may have cooked too hot, especially if you used an unrefined oil   Refined olive oils work well for cooking chicken. I used to do it a lot, either by pouring some into a pan and adding the chicken, or by brushing large pieces of chicken with oil, and sprinkling herbs and black pepper on the surface.  Now I don't cook chicken but do the same with veg, tofu, etc.  Again a little sweetness (from well-cooked onions for example) mutes any  bitter flavour.</p>\n",

Becuase proteins have complex strucures that enable them carry out their purpose, changes to the structure 'destroy' the protein, i.e. destroy their ability to carry out their purpose.\nNote that denatured alcohol is different. the structure of alcohol is too simple to destroy (unfold).

If any of these are not accurate, please let me know!</p>\n<p>Assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improperly handled food kept at low oxygen (e.g. submerged in liquid) carries a risk of causing deadly botulism.</li>\n<li>The bacteria that create botulism toxin require certain conditions: low oxygen, low acidity, low salt, low sugar, sufficient protein content, correct temperature range.</li>\n<li>Lacto-fermenting vegetables in a salt brine carries little to no risk of botulism, and no case of botulism has ever been reported from lacto-fermenting vegetables.</li>\n<li>Lacto-fermenting meats and dairy products must be done in a cold environment like a refrigerator to prevent the risk of botulism.</li>\n<li>Lacto-fermenting protein-rich vegetables (e.g peas, beans) can be safely done at room temperature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So my question is: what's so special about meat and dairy that it carries a high risk of botulism? Botulism can occur from improperly canned beans, yet fermenting beans at room temperature is okay. Why is it not okay to lacto-ferment meat at room temperature? What's different about meat vs. high-protein vegetables?</p>\n<p>And a follow up question: could there be any substitute safety measures other than refrigeration to make room temperature meat fermentation safe? E.g. Extra salt, acid, finely shredding the meat (to ensure brine penetration), etc.?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>My main motive for this question is determining whether room temperature preservation of cooked meet is possible using a salt brine + other vegetables / ingredients in a process similar to lacto-fermentation; I'm not concerned with the technicality of whether the bacteria feed off the meat or if the meat truly &quot;ferments&quot;; I'm only concerned with preservation. Example: if adding freshly cooked (i.e. mostly sterile) meat to a jar of fermenting vegetables (at any stage of fermentation) effectively prevents spoilage of the meat, I would consider that an answer to my question. If not, the reason why not would also be a good answer.</p>\n",

To look at each:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assumptions 1,2 and 3 are true.</li>\n<li>Assumption 4 is false. You can't lacto ferment meat. There is only the edge case of cured sausages, and their fermentation process is very far from the lactofermentation of vegetables. Lacto fermenting dairy is done at high temperatures - from about 20ish celsius for Kefir, to up to 45 for some strains of yogurt culture.</li>\n<li>I can't comment on Assumption 5, since I have never looked into lacto-fermentation of legumes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at these assumptions, it looks as if you are equating the absence of botulism bacteria with food safety. This is certainly not the case! There are dozens of different kinds of bacteria which can cause food poisoning, most of which are more difficult to guard against than botulism bacteria.</p>\n<p>Whenever you leave some food sitting out, you create a new microenvironment which gets colonized by its own ecosystem of microorganisms. Which type of organism will grow and displace all others is dependent on the conditions you offer it, just like in your assumption 2. It just so happens that, if you leave out vegetables at room temperature with the right amount of salt, it is the benign lactobacilii which proliferate best and occupy all the ecological niches in your fermentation jar. By the way, your fermentation can go wrong and create the wrong microorganisms, but they will not be c.b., that is usually seen under much stricter anaerobic conditions, such as in canned food and sometimes under oil.</p>\n<p>But meat is not a vegetable; it is a different source of food, on which lactobacilii cannot thrive. Instead, you get other types of bacteria on meat, usually ones which cause food poisoning. To prevent that, you have to preserve meat by making it inedible for any kind of bacteria, before they have overtaken it. This creates different curing methods for it, which require very tight control and multiple bacteria-controlling methods at once (e.g. cold temperature plus the right amount of salt) to get a safe cured meat.</p>\n<p>If you were to just leave your meat out in the conditions for a vegetable lacto-fermentation, you would get neither a lacto-fermentation, nor botulism, but just a crock full of spoiled meat, ready to give you some kind of non-botulinic food poisoning.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update</strong> To the point in your edit: It is absolutely not safe to just add meat to properly fermenting vegetables. Actually food safety is much more cautious than that, and any kind of self-experimented recipe is not safe by definition, but this is one of the rare cases which are not just unsafe, but decidedly dangerous. Probably not because of botulism, but the other types of food poisoning are no joke either.</p>\n",

A bare steel pot is the opposite of non-reactive. Tomato sauce, jams/jellies, pretty much any acidic food...</p>\n<p>Unless you have no other pot and no way to get another pot (such as a secondhand store if cash is tight) I would suggest not bothering, but folks cooked in cast iron kettles before our time, so you certainly can cook in plain steel. Some foods may discolor, and you'll need to promptly clean, dry and oil the pot after every use in the battle against rust.</p>\n",

This happens whether or not use use a splash screen.  To have any luck cleaning this, you have to get it right after cooking, and you have to work at it quite a bit with an abrasive cleaner. When it first appears, if you catch it before burning, it is usually brown. After a couple of uses (or high heat, long enough) it will blacken and be even more difficult to remove.  Some folks like a shiny exterior and will work at this diligently after each use.  Personally, I don't give the exterior of my pans much attention.

While heat can in general be important to rupture cell walls and such to support dissolving, paprika is already pretty finely ground so it\u2019s largely a matter of dissolution rate.</p>\n<p>Failing that, though, you can use the microwave. This is a bit tricky, as small quantities of low-water solutions will heat \u2014 and burn \u2014 <em>very quickly</em>. But if you\u2019re quick about it, you can bring paprika up to infusing temperature almost instantly. Note that the oil is not heated as fast as the paprika, despite there being more of it, so you\u2019ll have to heat it 3-4 times. The basic recipe is, microwave it until the moment <em>anything happens</em> (sizzling, bubbling, w/e) and then immediately turn it off. Wait a few seconds for the heat to disperse and then turn it on again. After 3-4 rounds let it rest for 5 mins and you will have infused oil.</p>\n",

What you probably mean is that you weren't able to make a homogenous mixture out of chocolate and the other ingredients listed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why doesn't coconut oil dissolve when cacao butter does</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You must have done something funny there. There are mixtures of coconut fat and chocolate, commonly eaten in Germany as Eiskonfekt. If you cannot improve your technique to the point where you can just mix chocolate and coconut fat, consider adding some cream to the chocolate first, that's another variation. In fact, if you speak German, your best bet is to find a recipe and follow it faithfully.</p>\n<p>As for all your other observations - I don't know if you are questioning them in some way, so I will just note that all of them (including that your volume is not preserved) are absolutely normal and aligned with what chemistry would predict and patissiers observe every day in working with chocolate.</p>\n",

But I used to.</p>\n<p>If you cover chicken strips in sodium bicarbonate (or soak them in a solution) you are marinading it in an alkaline solution. My guess is that if you do this long enough, the first millimetre or so of the chicken will break down a little and absorb some of that bicarbonate.</p>\n<p>If you then stir fry it at high temperature, especially with something acidic, such as lime (the fruit juice!), then the acid and alkali will react by foaming which will further break down and soften the chicken surface.</p>\n<p>It would need a long marinade and the other acid ingredient to work, I guess (though heat does activate baking soda) but I would think that without a high heat the chicken won\u2019t cook fast enough for the effect to be noticeable.</p>\n<p>So the blanching in hot oil as mentioned above makes some sense.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, why bother? Instead use great ingredients - fresh free range organic poultry cooked just beyond pink is out of this world and doesn\u2019t need to be treated with anything.</p>\n<p>The best stir fry I have had have all been home cooked, with minimum ingredients - maybe some fresh ginger and garlic with pak choi..</p>\n",

I've been reading plenty of resources online however there are a lot conflicts from different sources. What I want to know is, what is the desirable temperature for cooking a bone broth over 12 hours without compromising the nutrients or gelatin?</p>\n<p>I usually make my stocks on quite a low simmer - no continuous bubbling but rather a few bubbles every 2 or 3 seconds. I've noticed some websites advising to cook at a much higher temperature around 98 deg celsius, which is quite an aggressive rolling simmer just shy of a boil. I'm concerned about this because in my experience, such aggressive bubbling would make it difficult for the impurities and scum to float on top of the water (well to be fair, I do blanch my ingredients first to get rid of scum) but also because gelatin only needs to reach 82 deg celsius to dissolve, and you might break down the gelatin into histamines at such a high temperature. At the same time, there does seem to be some value in raising the temperature a little more than a low simmer as you can reduce the cooking time whilst not affecting the quality of the what you end up with much. Is there a sweet-spot between a low simmer and an aggressive simmer for optimal results?</p>\n",

The difference in effect on food and cooking is a result of the motion (or lack thereof) in the pot. I write &quot;or very close to&quot; because a rolling boil ensures there is efficient mixing of the ingredients in the pot, so the temperature throughout is more likely to equilibrate. The motion of a rolling boil also impacts the ingredients in the pot, which are pushed around and knocked into one another.

                "body": "<p>It is not true that your oven is at 400 degrees, that's a convenient fiction which is easy to put on a dial.</p>\n<p>In fact, an oven has two heating elements, which are pumping energy into the inside of the oven. The oven dial just determines the energy that will be emitted, averaged over a longish period of time. The energy is transferred to the oven walls, the air in the oven, the food, and the pan material.</p>\n<p>Out of those, the food is the worst heat sink you have. The air has almost no mass, and is heated quickly. The metal conducts heat well, heats up quickly, and starts emitting itself once heated. The organic matter in your food is slow to heat up, especially by conduction from the warm air. Direct radiation from the heat element contributes a lot, especially to surface browning. And of course, for the conduction to happen, you need the air layer close to the food to be warm, not a wad of cooled down air which just exchanged its energy with the food.</p>\n<p>As soon as you fill your oven up, these effects are disturbed. For conduction, you get the same amount of energy, but it has to be exchanged with a much higher mass, so you get less energy per unit of food. For convection, Ecnerwal already explained that the foods block the flow of air, so the air surrounding the food is colder than it would have been. And for radiation, the upper crust of the uppermost food absorbs everything coming from the upper element, and the lower crust of the lowermost food absorbs from below.</p>\n<p>The oven is not a completely dumb device, it does have a sensor, and so it should keep the heating elements turned on for longer in such a situation than in an emptier oven. But first, as Ecnerwal pointed out, the sensor has an arbitrary position that is not so close to the food, and you have created a situation in which the heat distribution within the oven is very unequal. And second, I would guess that, even if it goes on for longer, it is just not sufficient to cook your food quicker. This is especially true with modern baking techniques, where we use light ovens and barely preheat them, so that they are nowhere close to thermal equilibrium when we add our food. This is a really good thing for both our wallets and the environment, but it does require you to get used to cooking times that vary with oven loading.</p>\n",

Further, most scales come with calibration procedures, but that calibration requires you to have a scientifically precise calibration weight to use.</p>\n<p>(My experience is based on teaching ceramics classes using cheap electronic scales, which has involved buying dozens of them and calibrating them myself.)</p>\n",

Also, does the peel color even matter if the inside of the banana is still more or less okay? If a banana is green with brown/black spots, does that say anything bad about the banana? Because bananas that ripen like that are often chemically treated or ripened, but it sometimes happens naturally as well.

If you unjar and continue drying as soon as you spot condensation, it generally won't spoil. You can use bags once you are sure it's dry (though if you are going to put them in mason jars anyway, the bags are a waste of plastic.)</p>\n<p>In my <em>personal</em> experience, the basil is better made into pesto and frozen than dried. But you can dry it if that's what you want.</p>\n<p>The oregano and rosemary should dry fine. <em>Though if you have any ability to not kill plants, a potted rosemary is not a very fussy houseplant, and you can have it fresh that way. Added after remembering to water mine...</em></p>\n<p>When I had an airy attic I could string herbs up in that got nice and hot, I'd put them there.

That gets most things done in a matter of days.</p>\n<p>Unless you are in a terribly dry climate I would not regard 4 days of heat and 3 weeks of room temperature (which may not dry at all, depending on the weather) as a particularly good regime - it certainly would not do much in my humid climate. At minimum, some additional time with heat before sealing up would likely help.</p>\n<p>There are various other &quot;tests&quot; for dryness of variable usefulness or reliability -  do stems snap <em>.vs.</em> bend? - Do leaves crumble <em>.vs.</em> crumple?</p>\n<p>If you happen to own or can borrow a dehumidifier, that would be a better way to heat and dry the room you are drying in than a resistance heater (does a better job making it dry, not just warm.)</p>\n",

When you cook them whole, the starch stays much less hydrated than when they are cut up in small pieces. Then you use a ricer to break them apart while hot (which is easy at that point, the cell walls separate of their own accord) and add the milk. The milk binds well with the starch, and makes a nice cohesive texture.</p>\n<p>You can get away with cubed potatoes too, but not as well as with whole ones. But if you shred them first, they might get soggy. I am not entirely sure if this will be the case if you make them in a sealed bag, but there will be juice getting out of the vacuoles, and it might be enough to make them waterlogged in the bag. If you cook shredded potatoes directly in water, they will go soggy for sure. And soggy potatoes do not make smooth, nice mash.</p>\n<p>In the end, people rice potatoes because it works. Depending on how frequently you make them, you can decide if you want to invest in a more complex hinged ricer, to stay with a simple stamping one, or just use a fork. You will still get better mash with less effort than cubing or shredding, then doing sous vide, then trying to puree them without blunt force.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>My hearsay answer to this is what I learned growing up in Greece (it might be totally wrong): use of hot spices is way more common in cultures living in hotter climates, and it has to do with something like food preservation, or hiding the loss of good taste in the time period when the food is still safe to eat, which would occur much faster in a climate hotter than ours. So, the short answer I learned from my mom and grandma is &quot;we don't need it&quot;, but hots (mostly in form of hot peppers, think of the Mediterranean version of jalapeno) were &quot;contained&quot; to certain foods if someone has the taste for them. And in general, they come with a warning that &quot;too much spice (meaning hot) is bad for your stomach&quot;. Sweet spices (e.g. cinnamon, nutmeg) are used in abundance for desserts.\n<br>One thing to remember also is availability, especially a few centuries ago. At least for the common folk, it's hard to make a case for expensive things that are grown an ocean away, when you have an abundance of herb bushes growing wild in your backyard - so I would certainly make a distinction between spices are native to the Mediterranean (e.g. saffron, coriander) vs things like allspice. And if you want something to overwhelm the taste, garlic does the trick very easily in (non-Americanized) Greek cuisine.</p>\n",

A longer extraction time is needed for the water fraction in the vodka to extract the non-volatile compounds for a balanced profile.</p>\n<p>Heating the extraction mix in an open/non-pressurized environment will cause the volatile compounds to evaporate instead of going into solution in the vodka. Similarly, dried cherries lose these volatile compounds in the dehydration process, but may be added in afterwards as 'natural flavour'.</p>\n<p>If it's specifically the 'vodka' taste that causes issues with your cherry flavouring, it's from  harsher-tasting non-ethanol fermentation products. They're characteristic for traditional vodkas, and prized for certain brands. You can try heating a small amount of your cherry vodka to simulate the heating from baking to see if these harsher compounds evaporate while leaving an acceptable amount of cherry flavour.</p>\n<p>Another technique to mask harsher vodka notes for cold applications would be to add sweetness and fruit acid. These are the non-volatile compounds that generally aren't extracted by alcohol and will remain in the cherry pulp. You may find that adding a bit of lemon juice (without zest!) and sugar syrup will balance out the profile in the cherry vodka you have now; or, if you have a test batch of your baking product, see if the flavour profile masks the harsh tastes.</p>\n<p>For future batches, you'll want to use a 'smoother' tasting vodka like Grey Goose, Belvedere, or Everclear where any taste will be easily masked by the cherries. Even better, use grain neutral spirit if you can source it to have nearly pure ethanol for extraction. Commercially available cherry extracts will use this as the carrier fluid for extraction or with synthesized cherry volatile compounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>From comments below:</p>\n<p><strong>NikkiBdraws</strong>: It's more that the cherry flavor isn't intense enough. Adding 1 or 2 teaspoons to whipped cream doesn't impart a noticeable taste like you would get with other extracts. But, you're saying that heating the vodka may help get rid of the harshness of the vodka so the cherry flavor stands out?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes - that relies on the cherry volatiles evaporating later than the vodka compounds, <em>and having enough cherry taste already extracted that losses are acceptable.</em></p>\n<p>Since the cherry intensity is lacking in the current batch, <em>to improve cold extraction</em> you could try re-extracting with the same cherries and vodka, add more cherries if available, and increase surface area - finely mash the cherries, or better finely blend the pitted cherries, then let settle and decant.</p>\n",

                "body": "<h2>Sorry, it won't work</h2>\n<p>You are not making an extract, at least not in the sense in which you are using the word. You seem to expect to use it as a flavoring for other foods, while what you are making is simply a liqueur.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to make that kind of concentrated flavoring in home conditions. It doesn't matter what you do - heat, time, or whatever. You neither have much flavor in the cherries to start with, nor do you have any efficient methods to get it out of the cherries, nor can you later concentrate the result.</p>\n<h2>Why do sources speak of &quot;extraction&quot;</h2>\n<p>The word &quot;extract&quot; has a much broader meaning in the kitchen than simply &quot;concentrated flavoring agent&quot;. When you find sources which suggest that longer time will give you better extraction, they mean that you will get a nicer, rounder-tasting liqueur with more subtle notes. If you try heat, you will get quicker to a cherry-tasting liquid, but it won't have a more intense taste, just a different (and harsher) cherry taste. There is a reason people pay more for longer-stored wines and vinegars, you cannot replace time by anything. Also, even if you start out with more cherries (or with dried cherries as suggested in other answers, which amounts to the same thing, more cherry mass per unit of alcohol), the results will be slightly more intense, but nowhere near the expectation you described.</p>\n<h2>How can you get cherry flavor instead</h2>\n<p>When you add liqueur to something like whipped cream, you do get a nice flavor note - but it will always be subtle, not a strong &quot;wow, I am eating cherry cream now&quot; feeling. If you want to get that, you have to use <strong>commercial flavoring</strong> - or better yet, do the main part with commercial flavoring, and also add a teaspoon of your liqueur, to round it out with more complexity from the actual cherry.</p>\n<p>A second option is to purchase <strong>freeze-dried cherry powder</strong>. It does have drawbacks, such as being very expensive, adding some slight grittiness to your cream, the need to use relatively large amounts (but at least it is dry, so it won't ruin whipped cream or ice cream bases) and not being as flavorful as an actual flavoring. But it is still popular with some bakers, and it does tick the &quot;there are real cherries in it&quot; psychological box. Again, you can combine it with a bit of liqueur for best results.</p>\n<p>If you really want a homemade route, the best thing to do is not to extract anything, but to use a <strong>dehydrator</strong>. You will have to puree or juice the cherries and start with a fruit leather recipe, but interrupt it before it has gone hard. You also have to stir every couple of hours, to prevent a skin from forming. The result will still not be as concentrated as a commercial flavoring, but you can create a variety of desserts if you use enough of it. For example, if you have access to double cream (48%) you can dilute it with the concentrated cherry puree down to 33% and whip that. Or, more doable, whip the cream separately, then fold the puree and a thickener to create a cherry mousse. If you have your own cherry tree, this is a great way to use up a large amount of cherries without producing a lot of dessert.</p>\n<p>I will mention briefly another option, because other answers talked so much about heat and volatility. If you feel playful and want to continue using alcohol and heat, your best option is to do a <strong>hot distillation</strong>. You don't even have to make cherry wine or cherry mash (although you could); redistilling your liqueur should work too. A small scale apparatus won't be too expensive, but you may have difficulty getting it locally if you live in a place with strong anti-moonshine laws. The downside is that the result will be not a flavoring, but a cherry brandy - which will have similar flavoring uses as the liqueur, but with a different flavor profile.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>It's normal to hear hissing from a pressure cooker, in fact it's a sign it's working. When you heat a pressure cooker the water inside turns to steam, which is captured by the seals to increase the pressure inside the vessel. Once the pressure reaches a certain point a valve will open to let some of the steam escape so the higher pressure is maintained at a constant level. If this valve didn't work then your pot could rupture if it's a very old one, so it's a very important safety feature for older cookers. Modern pressure cookers have redundant safety features like pressure plugs to ensure safety.</p>\n<p>Note that lack of a hiss doesn't always mean you are in imminent danger, usually it's a sign you don't have a good seal rather than a bad valve. I would suggest you track down the hiss, if it's coming from the valve then it's normal operation, if it's coming from around the lid then it's not sealed properly. When tracking the hiss down remember it's steam escaping and be careful not to burn yourself. If you can't see where steam is escaping you can use a big spoon to detect it rather than your ear, or a mechanic's trick is to use a short piece of hose or straw as a stethoscope.</p>\n",

Going slightly away from the optimal conditions will result in lower quality, since it will shift the microbial balance in your yogurt. Going further away is a safety risk, since it will shift the balance far enough that pathogenic bacteria might get a foothold, instead of being outcompeted by your starter. And going very far off (such as trying to ferment a 43C starter at 30 C) will likely result in complete failure, because your starter won't multiply.</p>\n<p>So, the main takeway: <strong>Always follow the exact procedure prescribed for your starter.</strong> This will not only give you the best quality and eliminate quite a few typical problems, but is also safest.</p>\n<p>As a small aside, I haven't yet encountered actual yogurt cultures that use a 20 C temperature, this sounds more like a kefir or a buttermilk culture. Regardless, the same rule applies. Stick with the temperature prescribed by the culture's producer.</p>\n",

Eaten by itself mango is very flavorful, especially when fresh and ripe, the frozen mango I've used is not that strong and can be overpowered by other flavors. So start with mango as the base, and add other liquids like stock, yogurt or coconut milk sparingly.</p>\n<p>If it's the spice not coming out then you may need to rethink the definition of generous. Good, strong curry flavor needs good, strong heaps of spices, especially if they aren't fresh or are weak to begin with like you get in many supermarkets. If you can source your spices from an asian supermarket, health food store or anywhere else that they get good quality. Buy small amounts often rather than big packets which then sit around for ages losing flavor.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>From what you have shared @ShadySpiritomb, I think the root cause could be the use of frozen rather than fresh mango. Most fruit has a very high water content, and freezing will cause the cell wall to rupture. When defrosted, the fruit will have a mushy consistency, and the flavour may be diluted by any additional moisture captured during the freezing process.</p>\n<p>The first thing I would do is defrost your mango in a sieve over a bowl in a refrigerator. That way, you can reheat the flesh separately in the sauce until you reach the correct consistency that you want for your curry. Before doing that, though, I would prepare a basic curry sauce by frying off onions, garlic, and whatever spices etc. you intend to use. Once these have been cooked off, I would add the reserved mango juice and reduce this by 30-60%, continually tasting until you are happy with the balance. By reducing the liquid, you will concentrate the mango flavour.</p>\n<p>Once this sauce is ready, add the mango and heat through. Depending on the condition of the defrosted mango, this may not need a long time; if the fruit is really &quot;mushy&quot;, heating through will probably be sufficent. If it needs longer to soften, add earlier in the process.</p>\n<p>If desired, any tomato or coconut milk etc. should be added after the mango juices have reduced and before you add the mango flesh.</p>\n",

Are there actual temperature ranges associated with these set phrases?</p>\n<p>I grew up in North America, in a household where we couldn't afford to overly heat the house in the winter, or cool it in the summer. &quot;Room temperature&quot; was, therefore, 50-55\u00b0F (10-12.7\u00b0C) in the winter, and 85-90\u00b0F (29-32\u00b0C) in the summer. My perception of &quot;room&quot; temperature is similarly skewed -- this isn't at all &quot;normal&quot; from a N. American perspective, where most of my peers like to keep their houses at around 77\u00b0F/25\u00b0C in the winter, and 67\u00b0F/19\u00b0C in the summer. But I remain confused, at least, from a culinary perspective of what exactly I'm being asked when a product indicates these set phrases.</p>\n<p>As a concrete example: I recently bought a tub of ghee. It indicates to me on the labelling that it does not require refrigeration, can be kept at &quot;room temperature&quot;, and should be stored in a &quot;cool, dry place&quot;. My apartment is 80\u00b0F/26.6\u00b0C right now -- is this &quot;room temperature&quot;? (It'll cool to ~61\u00b0F/16\u00b0C overnight.) In the meantime, it's significantly warmer than the store shelf I bought it from, and the ghee has gone from a soft solid to pure liquid. This change of state (solid -&gt; liquid) is what prompted my concern that I'm misinterpreting &quot;room temperature&quot; in terms of food temperature and safety.</p>\n",

There are optimal conditions hiding behind each of these terms, and the farther you go from them, the quicker your food will deteriorate, in noticeable ways like mold, or unnoticeable like the slow loss of aroma in spices.

But there is no reason to think it shouldn't be done (except for it being very difficult) - the seasoning will stick to the pan as well as to iron pans.</p>\n<p>Cast iron pans are easier than others to season, because cast iron is able to really pump a lot of energy into the layer of matter right next to itself. I am not a physicist and don't know which property of the metal makes it work this way. But you will notice that nothing browns food like a well-preheated* cast-iron pan. Even forged iron isn't as good.</p>\n<p>Your ceramic pan is almost certainly not cast iron, but either steel or aluminum. Which means that you cannot enjoy the cast iron properties, which would crisp your oil into a proper firm polymer. You may try to get it to work nevertheless, by changing the hob setting and/or the time you heat the pan, but it may be that the margin you have between &quot;bad, sticky seasoning&quot; and &quot;burned oil&quot; becomes so thin that you never catch it.</p>\n<p>So, if you decide to go for it, just continue deseasoning and reseasoning, testing out different variations of temperature control, until you get it to work. If you decide against it, you can still use the pan - ceramic pans with used-up coating tend to perform much the same in terms of stickiness as uncoated stainless steel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>* this might take much longer than you think, I once had a huge amount of vegetables which I browned side-by-side on all available hobs, and the cast iron pan started visibly outperforming the other pans around 45 min into the process</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Most of the [I hesitate only slightly to call them clickbait] recipes for chicken noodle soup using <em>only</em> a chicken breast make up their entire flavour profile using ready-made stock. The chicken breast is nothing more than something to look at, a bit of decoration so you can call it chicken soup. It will add very little flavour to the soup at all.</p>\n<p>To really make it from scratch you need to start with either a whole chicken [quartered], or even less fuss, a carcass left over from yesterday's roast dinner, optionally plus your single raw breast to add at the end, for some 'chunks'. Personally I'd just make sure I started with enough meat left on the carcass &amp; skip the fresh at the end. Alternatively, add a couple of fresh thighs cooked as long as the carcass. Fresh thighs will get tender over time, fresh breast will become like so much pencil eraser.<br />\nThe 'body' of your soup will really come from the 'bits you don't eat' - the skin, bones, cartilage etc. This will develop not only a much deeper flavour, but texture &amp; mouth-feel, it will naturally slightly thicken the soup.</p>\n<p>Throw the carcass in with any or all of - onions, celery, carrots, garlic, fresh thyme, parsley, salt &amp; black pepper [&amp;/or anything in the fridge that needs using up].<br />\nSimmer until it completely falls apart - call it three to four hours. This is one of those things it's pretty hard to over-cook, so don't be in a hurry. You can play with your final flavour profile by reducing at a boil or adding water. [You lose less if you make it a little strong &amp; have to knock it back, of course. Boiling boils off a part of the flavour - you can smell it in the room], also check seasoning part-way &amp; again at the end.<br />\nLift out all the bones, skin, anything you don't want in the final soup, shred any remaining chicken into easily spoonable sizes.<br />\nDice your fresh chicken if you are using it, and add with or after your noodles, depending on how long the noodles need.\nFresh diced chicken breast takes about 2 minutes; most people over-cook it [pencil erasers again]. Check one of the largest pieces for doneness.</p>\n<p>If you leave out the fresh breast, your soup will freeze nicely, with or without the noodles.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Based on your recipe, things I would change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of boiling, bring the water to a boil, then immediately drop to a simmer. Cooking things too hot too fast almost always results in degradation of flavor, and in a soup you generally need a long cook time to get the flavors to diffuse and blend properly, so you need a lower temperature for cooking.</li>\n<li>Gently saut\u00e9 or roast the onion before using it in the soup. Ideally, do this in the bottom of the pot you\u2019re cooking the soup in so you get all the flavors in the stock. This will help bring out the flavors more, as well as making the onions softer in the final soup.  Possibly do the same with the chicken.</li>\n<li>Unless you particularly dislike garlic, use at least another teaspoon, possibly more. A number of the compounds in garlic (or produced as part of cooking with it) act as flavor enhancers, much the same way that salt does.</li>\n<li>Grind the spices using a mortar and pestle before adding them. The higher surface area will transfer a lot more flavor and also help the flavor diffuse better throughout the soup.</li>\n<li>Consider using more chicken. One breast is not a lot for that much soup, so the flavor from it is not going to be particularly strong. This is especially the case if the breast is boneless, as soaking the bones is a large part of what adds flavor to meat broths.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, consider using bouillon cubes (chicken bouillon would be the natural choice here) or even instant dashi (if you are going for an East Asian flavor) to add to the flavor without adding a lot of extra calories.</li>\n<li>Consider using an oil other than canola oil. Canola oil has very little flavor, which makes it useful in some cases (for example, as a carrier for flavors that don\u2019t blend well with water), but not as great in others. Depending on the exact flavor you\u2019re going for, I would consider olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, or even coconut oil.</li>\n<li>Consider using more vegetables. Top of the list for me would be celery and/or carrots (probably diced and saut\u00e9ed alongside the onions, so you get something a bit like a mirepoix as a base). Both are flavorful vegetables that work well in soup. Other possibilities that come to mind include tomato (either as a paste or finely diced, added later on), daikon (will add some texture because it stays crunchy even when cooked), or some variety of mushrooms (I would probably use shitake or boletes).</li>\n</ul>\n",

                "body": "<p>This is because your plan is contradictory - the flours you have chosen are not suitable to producing a fluffy tortilla.</p>\n<p>The largest problem is that your flours don't contain gluten. Without gluten, you can't get a fluffy dough that holds the miniature air bubbles contained in wheat flour doughs. The second problem is the chickpea flour - it is a rather chunky flour, which stays hard-ish even after full hydration.</p>\n<p>The closest solution you will get is to start with oat flour only, without chickpea, and add vital wheat gluten to about the same percentage as found in all-purpose flour (8-9% of total weight, if your gluten is pure). Then do a couple of batches to test and fine-tune the recipe.</p>\n<p>Once you have oat-with-gluten tortillas working, you can start doing new batches, gradually adding some chickpea flour. Make sure to leave the dough rest for a several hours, to hydrate the chickpea properly - or maybe even ditch the flour and use cooked, ground chickpeas, just like you'd prepare for hummus. You will soon find the proportion at which the chickpeas can be added without ruining the texture.</p>\n",

As you noted, it will prevent skin formation from dehydration, and as @Joe noted it will inhibit oxidation - it's the ideal method for guacamole.</p>\n<p>Another effect for method 2, as a non-polar surface, is that the film can adsorb certain non-polar compounds. For example, it can pick up unwanted green or yellow lipid-soluble pigments on the surface of a cream soup, or the 2,4,6-trichloroanisole responsible for cork taint in a glass of wine. A downside effect is that it can wick oils from the surface of the food over the rim and onto the exterior of the container.</p>\n<p>My preference is method 1 with two opposing sides lifted for convection then sealed when fully cooled, and method 2 for for specific use cases.</p>\n",

It was the only kind I had ever tasted up until I was around eleven or twelve. When I went to visit my friends' houses, and if they had Mexican food that I didn't like, they offered to give me whatever leftover Spanish rice they had. I immediately noticed the difference: it was rich and flavourful and perfectly balanced, plus it was a little bit creamy.</p>\n<p>I recently got enrolled in my state's independent skills-training programme because of my blindness and other disabilities, and my skills coach and I found a basic Spanish rice recipe that had the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 US cups of rice</li>\n<li>1/8 cup of vegetable oil</li>\n<li>6 stems of cilantro (optional)</li>\n<li>1 tsp salt</li>\n<li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>\n<li>4 cups water with 1 cube chicken bouillon or 4 cups chicken broth and no bouillon</li>\n<li>a dash of cumin to taste</li>\n<li>a dash of garlic pepper to taste</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We started by browning the rice before adding the minced garlic, letting it saute for about a minute. Here's where things get a little weird. I will differentiate the different method that my mother did it versus how my skills coach taught me to do it using <em>A</em> for my mother and <em>B</em> for my trainer. I told my mother exactly how to follow the directions, but being blind, she could've done something that I couldn't see.</p>\n<p>A. Let the rice fry (with onion) for about five to ten minutes until they are really dark before adding the tomatoes.</p>\n<p>B. Let the rice and garlic fry for about a minute or two before adding in the tomatoes.</p>\n<p>A. Since we didn't have any tomato sauce, we blended the tomatoes thoroughly and poured them into the rice.</p>\n<p>B. Boil the tomatoes until they are soft and mushy, and then mash them up thoroughly before pouring it into the rice since we didn't have any tomato sauce.</p>\n<p>A and B. Add the bouillon cube and spices.</p>\n<p>A. Pour four cups of plain water.</p>\n<p>B. Add four cups of the water used to boil the tomatoes so as to add more tomato flavour.</p>\n<p>A. Cover the pan and simmer for about fifteen to twenty minutes (this is where it starts to smell strong).</p>\n<p>B. Cover the lid and let simmer for about forty-five minutes (doesn't smell as strong).</p>\n<p>The result is that the rice my mother made has almost no flavour, tastes like cardboard, and has a weird smokey-like aroma to it, whereas the one my direct support provider and I tastes much more palatable, has a creamy texture, and feels much more fluffier in general. When I asked my mother why it had that strong aroma, she simply claimed that it was the onion, but I don't think that is the case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>could overfrying and/or undersimmering the rice caused this to happen?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If not, what else could've gone wrong to cause such a thing to occur?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

You can use a fairly large amount of pressure with a wooden utensil and still not damage the nonstick coating, since the wood is not nearly as hard as the coating.

Stainless steel is one of the stickiest kinds of pan there are. You always need sufficient oil with it, the fat in the patties is nowhere near enough to let them release. The Leidenfrost is only one of many effects that happen during cooking, and the sticking properties of the beef proteins will easily overcome it even without the intentional smashing. It is a nice indicator of preheating, but you cannot rely on it to prevent sticking. You are right to think that the meat will stick more and burn, instead of releasing on its own.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, use oil, and in sufficient quantities.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>It depends on what the &quot;thick cream&quot; actually is.</p>\n<p>If the cream was made by taking milk (plain or cultured) and then mechanically churning it to a specific consistency - basically making dairy cream with more fat than your double cream - it will work. Any percentage cream or milk is mixable with any other, and you can calculate the resulting percentage in simple linear fashion. That is, if you mix equal parts 30% cream and 50% cream, the result will behave like 40% cream. The same will work if it was made by scooping up the butterfat risen to the top of cooked milk - which is the original, homemade meaning of &quot;kaymak&quot;, but is almost never made, because of the huge expenditure of milk.</p>\n<p>I am a bit skeptical about your product being exactly that though, so I will also mention other cases. First, if it is indeed made by churning, but the actual goal is butter, and it is simply not-yet-quite butter, it is questionable whether it will work, but I suspect that it won't. An elderly relative used to make homemade butter that way, and it was unlike commercial butter, but white, with higher water content, spreadable - and with a clearly crystalline structure, with the butterfat already coalesced. If you live in a place where this product is made but called &quot;cream&quot; instead of &quot;butter&quot;, you can try it, but the chance of success is not all that high.</p>\n<p>The second thing that could work is mascarpone. It is nominally a cheese, but in fact its texture combines with cream quite well, and the mixture can be whipped (I have tried it personally). Also, the taste is so bland that the result will taste like whipped cream, not salty or with cheesy notes.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of other dairy-based spreads though, made in different ways, and pretty much none of them will work. Some are actually cheeses, like cream cheese (not only the American style, but also variations like Krema on the Balkans), ricotta, and others. There are also cultured dairy products (cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche), reduced milks and creams like katmach and evaporated milk, and modern technological creations that use thickeners (frequently labelled just &quot;spread&quot; in the supermarket, but modern kaymak from the store is also made that way). If you don't know exactly how your spread is produced, it is more likely to be one of those, than to be churned-cream-halfway-to-butter.</p>\n<p>So, if I were you, I would certainly do it if I knew it for sure to be a churned cream. Else, I would not expect it to work, but maybe make an experimental batch just to see what happens, fully prepared for it to not whip.</p>\n",

If the amount of water was very small it might extract less, but if there is enough water to cover the ingredients then additional water won't extract more.</p>\n<p>My reasoning (armchair speculation, not experimental evidence) is that the difference in concentration between the ingredients and stock (however strong it is) is so big that changing the amount of water wouldn't make much of a difference to the extraction. As heuristic evidence, I've heard of chefs using a pressure cooker and lots of time to make better stock, but I've never heard of someone advising a huge amount of water, or to change the water half-way through in order to extract more flavour compounds, which is what I'd expect high-end chefs to do if that worked.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the stock with double the water will be more dilute than the stock with less water: the flavour will be less strong because the same quantity of flavour compounds will be spread across a greater volume. You can concentrate it more by allowing water to evaporate over time depending on the strength you want at the end.</p>\n",

And certainly a larger variety of reactions happens when you have more ingredients in the pot - simply because you have a larger variety of inputs to react with each other.</p>\n<p>Thousands of years of observation have found out that this results in tastier meals with less effort. First, it increases the complexity of the taste you create. Second, you want to brown the other ingredients too, not just the meat. Given the choices of 1) brown the meat and not the others, 2) brown each ingredient separately, and 3) brown all ingredients in the same pan at the same time, you will find out that the third option is the easiest one logistically, and gives you a somewhat better taste than the second, and a hugely better one than the first. This is why cooks do it that way.</p>\n<p>The kernel of truth in your assumption is that indeed, Maillard reactions happen there. They happen both when you cook the meat alone, and when you cook it with other ingredients. It is even plausible that different reactions happen when you cook it alone than with other stuff (e.g. meat protein reacts with meat sugars, vs. meat protein reacts with onion sugars). But that's only a tiny fraction of what happens when you cook the food. So I would not declare it &quot;the reason&quot;. The reason is the total combination of all these not-yet-researched reactions that happen when you brown meat and vegetables and seasonings together, which chefs like to think of as the art and magic of cooking.</p>\n",

You say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The final result tastes great</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have you ever forgotten the baking powder in a cake completely? It doesn't taste great; it is a stodgy lump, wet and &quot;unbaked&quot;. It is nowhere near &quot;great&quot;, almost inedible. The baking powder probably worked, and the banana bread was properly leavened, just without reaching some spectacular extra volume.</p>\n<p>So here are a few possibilities for your observation of a reduced effect:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Mixing. It is easier to mix baking powder with flour than with a thick liquid. If it stayed localized in a single clump, the rest won't have risen.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Timing. Baking powder relies on a chemical reaction which produces bubbles. The gluten in the batter doesn't let these bubbles rise up and disappear right away. This is why you don't want the reaction to start before the flour is in the batter. If you first mixed the wet ingredients, and they stayed around a bit before adding the flour, you may have spent the baking powder. This is especially problematic if it isn't double-acting (most current ones are, but there are retro, tartarate and organic brands which aren't). The same thing can happen if you let the batter rest for a long time before baking.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you had another mishap and used baking soda in a recipe intended for baking powder.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Proportion. This may be simply due to the proportion of baking powder you used. If you normally use self-raising flour, you may have miscalculated the amount needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

That's why you're supposed to mix the dry ingredients thoroughly, add the wet, and just fold it together. If you keep mixing the batter, at some point you end up <em>kneading</em> instead of <em>mixing</em>, and gluten will form. Which will make the final result too dense. (Gluten is good in 'proper' bread, as it can maintain the structure during the prolonged rising and baking. But for a cake that rises quickly, with carbon dioxide bubbles from the baking powder (or -soda), you don't want that.)</p>\n<p>Also, modern baking powder is 'double acting' and will release some gas when mixing with the water, and some when heating. You probably lost out on the first half.</p>\n",

It is just one of several types of browning, and it only serves to improve the taste somewhat, not to cook your food through.</p>\n<p>The most important types of chemical and physical processes during cooking (and by &quot;cooking&quot;, I mean applying heat to food, not other modes of preparation) are the denaturing of proteins, the breaking down of cellulose and hemicellulose in plant cell walls, the hydration and gelatinatization of starch, the dissolving of different molecules (e.g. sugars) in your cooking liquid or in the &quot;own juice&quot; exiting the cells, and the changes in aggregate state of lipids (which are much more complicated than the three phase transitions you learned in high school, with their amorphous solid state and tendency to emulsify). This is a rough list of what makes noticeable changes to texture and digestibility; there are also tons of reactions which influence flavor, or are unnoticeable by the eater.</p>\n<p>Also, you seem to think that chemical and physical reactions are quick. Maybe high school chemistry is also to blame for this; the teachers tend to demonstrate quick-and-spectacular ones; sitting around watching iron rust does not make for good teaching. In fact, many chemical reactions are slow, and some of those in cooking are also slow.</p>\n<p>In many cases in the kitchen, slow cooking is even preferred. It creates a much nicer, rounder taste, and sometimes a more pleasant texture. Tamales are intentionally designed for slow-cooking; both the steaming (which is slower than boiling) and the wrapping in leaves slows down the heat transfer, and ensures that they can sit around for a long time at heat without overcooking. So yes, it is perfectly normal for them to need a few hours even for the reactions which would be quicker in other dishes, such as the starch gelatinization, which is responsible for the sensory transition from &quot;doughy dough&quot; to &quot;cooked-through-dough&quot;.</p>\n",

(To be more specific: my initial idea was the type of grill that has a grid suspended over exposed heating elements. There are also types with integrated or exchangable plates that look like big sandwich toasters, but to get a satisfying result with these you'll have to opt for at least the mid price range because in my experience cheap devices don't produce enough heat.)</p>\n<p>You can put meat, veggies and bread or buns on the grill without adding any fat at all. Since power consumption is roughly comparable to frying the same ingredients in a pan, the only extra cost of this method is the initial cost for the grill. If you don't like cleaning the grill, there are special sheets available (like parchment paper, but more sturdy) that you can put between the grill and the food to ease cleaning.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage is that the food items need to be a minimum size in order to not fall through the grid. Some things like fried eggs or pancakes are also not rally practical to do on a grill, even if you have a sheet for it. I would rather fry / bake such things in a non-stick pan with a tiny amount of vegetable oil.</p>\n",

                "body": "<h3>Don't cook them so long</h3>\n<p>Everyone in Britain knows the jokes about &quot;Bonfire night is done, so it's time to put your sprouts on for Christmas&quot;.  Historically, us Brits have always boiled everything to death, until it's bland, pallid and generally gross.  Don't go there.</p>\n<p>The longer things stay in the water, the more flavour you'll lose.  If you cut your veg more finely, you'll reduce the cooking time (which means you get to eat sooner, yay!) and get better flavours.  Baton your carrots.  Shred your cabbage.  Break your broccoli down to smaller florets.  You'll prefer the results.</p>\n<h3>Use less water, and avoid pan lids</h3>\n<p>We all know that some of the flavour of <em>anything</em> comes out into the medium you put it into, right?  That's literally how you make a stock, after all.  And of course, some of the flavour of the cooking medium goes back into what you're cooking too.</p>\n<p>If you use less water, whatever flavour comes out is less dissolved.  If you think of soluble flavour elements reaching some kind of &quot;equilibrium&quot; with the water and whatever you're cooking, then the less water you have, the less you'll get dissolved.  So you only need just enough to cover the veg, and no more.</p>\n<p>More interestingly though, consider what happens when you leave the pan lid off.  The water evaporates, concentrating whatever is in the water.  Now you actually have that going back into the veg, which is great.  You'll need to watch it carefully, mind, because you can't let it boil dry.</p>\n<p>For carrots, parsnips, swede, and any other sugary veg, this will transform your results.  The cooking water actually reduces to a sweet syrup, full of the flavour of your veg, which packs flavour back into your veg.  Even better though, reducing a syrup over heat is how you make a caramel, right?  If you want to get super fancy, you can take your carrots out when they're cooked, caramelise the syrup a bit, and drizzle your carrot caramel back over.  A little maple syrup in the water for seasoning (not flavouring!) can bring that out a bit more too.</p>\n<h3>Grill your meat</h3>\n<p>I can't imagine how you've missed this.  It's the healthiest way to cook fatty meat anyway.  For unfatty meat like chicken breasts, put it on foil - staying in the cooking juices will keep it moist.</p>\n<h3>Braise your meat</h3>\n<p>For braising, the meat doesn't actually sit in the water.  Instead it sits on a bed of veggies and gradually bakes/steams.  You need to make sure it stays moist and keep basting the meat, but it can give you really nice results.  It's a good option for slow-cooking.</p>\n",

The plastic shell is going to inhibit heat flow, so they won't cool the water as quickly</li>\n<li>Gel ice packs: these have silica gel in them which allows them to be flexible even when partially frozen. They also freeze at a lower temperature than ice, so they come out colder, which is an advantage, however they are designed to give longer lasting cold, used in a cooler or on an injury, so not necessarily the best for your application</li>\n<li>Ice: either in cubes or small-medium sized blocks ice will give you the fastest cooling as there's a lot of surface area</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So ice is definitely the best choice, however if all you want to do is cool some sous vide steaks down packs may do okay.

It's very possible that the flour has simply gotten compacted by the weight on top of it rather than from moisture, if the flour is dry it's much more likely to be safe. A year is a long time to store flour, though, so you may be smelling some of the oils in the flour having turned rancid - even if it's safe it may not be good.</p>\n<p>To test for moisture you need an accurate scale and an oven.  You take a decent sized sample, say 100g, spread it out on a tray and bake it for an hour at medium temperature (130C/260F) to drive the moisture out. You weigh it straight after taking it out of the oven and measure the difference. If the water content is above 15% it's been exposed to too much moisture. So if you bake 100g and it comes out at 86g or higher at least you know it's not damp.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to use the flour you'll want to sift it at least once to aerate it and bring back its fluffiness.</p>\n",

She mixes them and, usually, makes some sort of dough she wants to bake.  She has a lot of fun doing this and it helps her experience new scents and flavors.  Historically we just buy cheap spices at the store and don't really overthink it.</p>\n<p>So far the main problems we have had are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We have a hard time finding complementary herbs/spices that can be mixed in somewhat arbitrary proportions and not end up completely disgusting.  Sometimes the spices conflict with each other and sometimes they are spices you generally don't use more than a tiny pinch.</li>\n<li>Since she wants to bake things, we try to provide something to make it &quot;bakeable&quot; such as baking soda, yeast, sometimes even eggs.  Usually, though, the end result is unappealing - often too spongy or too hard - and she doesn't want to try it.  When it isn't unappealing she really likes it and finds it rewarding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It would be really nice if we could put a little more prep work into this and be able to give her all her ingredients to play with, knowing that they are the right proportions that make something relatively palatable in the end, and be able to do this repeatedly.</p>\n<p>She does also help us with &quot;real&quot; recipes which is obviously a critical thing for helping hear learn and understand cooking, but this self-directed play is really important to her and helps expand her palate and calm her.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if I could come up with the following system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>measure out a set of ingredients and put them into appropriately-sized jars</li>\n<li>nearly all ingredients are dry and would not spoil in a week or so</li>\n<li>give her all the jars on a baking sheet along with any water needed</li>\n<li>have a pre-defined temperature and time for baking</li>\n<li>when combined, the entirety of the ingredients would be tasty when baked</li>\n<li>when some ingredients are not fully used (randomly), would not be terrible when baked</li>\n<li>clean up afterwards; be able to repeat this over and over without too much expense (no saffron, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How can I approach this task?</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Reading your description feels very good, but I am afraid that there is nothing you can do to achieve this exact dream.</p>\n<p>But whatever your views on parenting, if you want to ensure edible results, you will have to drop the rule that she can mix and match whatever she wants. Instead, she will have to learn a small set of combinations that work, and always make one of these, with some variation, but not much. This would basically mean that you choose a real recipe, and require her to follow it. Or you drop the edibility requirement, and let her continue what she has been doing.</p>\n<p>There are other areas in the kitchen where a mix-and-match is completely possible and the results are pretty much always edible. An illustrative example (I know, it hurts other requirements) would be a fruit salad - you can just provide prepared, cut-up fruit, and she can mix it in any proportions and combinations and get a tasty result. Or you could use breakfast cereal - from my point of view, any combination of the typical ingredients is as edible as any other, although you might turn out to have different preferences. But baking is a different beast, and you cannot leave out the structural components of a cake or cookie, and have an edible cake or cookie.</p>\n<p>If you absolutely want to try the curation thing: since people tend to like combinations which are familiar, your best bet on mutually compatible spices is to restrain her to the individual ingredients of some common spice mix. These mixes rarely have more than 4-5 spices tops, and at the same time, they are not foolproof. Imagine what will happen if you choose a gingerbread mix and she makes it 90% cloves. So the best compromise you can achieve will combine the worst features of both worlds.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this doesn't have to be a problem. Here I am deviating from cooking a bit, but what is happening from the parenting perspective: your daughter has already found a game which she enjoys (play-baking) and now you are coming in and adding an additional requirement or a rule (the result should be enjoyable to eat). This is pretty much the opposite of current parenting advice: recommendation tend towards self-directed play, and that, if the adult joins, they take their directions from the child, instead of imposing their own preferences on the whole thing. So, if the game is already working, then she can just keep playing it the same way, no need to change.</p>\n",

They're fairly forgiving on the proportions, so I reckon you could provide oats, butter, sugar and/or syrup, and some of dried fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, cinnamon, and other sweet spices in small quantities. Candied peel might be interesting too. Everything on this list is safe to taste raw. I'd weigh out enough butter and sugar to make flapjack. If they don't use it all, you'll get something crispier. If they don't use all the oats you'll get something more fudge-like.</p>\n<p>Melting the butter and sugar together would need some supervision but with small enough oven gloves and a heavy pan it's possible (my daughter made similar things at a similar age, though with less experimenting). Of course you're likely to need to handle the oven too. Someone will have to keep an eye on timing, but there's room to experiment there as well.</p>\n<p>Whether the result is chewy, crunchy, crumbly, or some combination, it should be decently edible as a snack, a breakfast cereal, or sprinkled on fruit salad or ice cream.</p>\n<p>A completely different, savoury, idea is seasoning for potato wedges. I make mine with polenta (for texture, optional) and a variety of herbs and spices (cumin, black pepper, paprika). Avoid anything too hot and have a play.

Quick breads are far less forgiving, but yeast bread is very adaptable. Likewise, by varying the amount of liquid you can range from loaf to flatbreads that are pourable (which is what I do with sourdough starter some would &quot;discard as excess&quot; - or when I feel like having some hot fresh bread product with minimal time and effort before I get around to bothering to loaf it with the rest of the dough-in-progress I took that material from.)</p>\n",

Just sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa butter -&gt; like normal dark chocolate.</li>\n<li>What is the color of cocoa butter extracted from Ruby cocoa beans? Is it pink or yellow?

Just like &quot;white chocolate&quot; is a specific combination of cocoa solids, cocoa fat, milk and sugar, milk chocolate is another combination of these, etc., so is ruby chocolate.</p>\n<p>So, to your points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why does Ruby chocolate have virtually no fiber in it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because it has almost no cocoa solids. You say that it has &quot;some&quot; cocoa solids, but the actual amount is very low. It is actually quite comparable to colored white chocolate, but the ingredient which gives it its coloring and aroma is extracted from a specifically preprocessed cocoa bean of certain varieties (&quot;ruby cocoa beans&quot;), not synthesized.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why does Ruby chocolate always contain milk in it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because that's what ruby chocolate is. It is the specific combination of milk, preprocessed ruby beans, etc. If you were to make dark chocolate out of the same beans, it would be dark chocolate, not ruby chocolate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the color of cocoa butter extracted from Ruby cocoa beans</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven't seen it done, so I cannot tell you what it looks like, physically. The liquor they use will certainly be colored, but it is also theoretically possible that the cocoa butter has a pink tinge.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why there isn't any Ruby cocoa powder available? I mean finely ground dry pink cocoa solids which are left after cocoa butter extraction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a marketing question, not a cooking question.

You can make a big batch and break it up into small servings, whereas if you did that with normal oatmeal you'd still have to have a way to reheat it to eat. And if you do that and make the oatmeal in the jar or whatever it will be stored in, there's only one thing to clean instead of two (bowl + pot you made it in).</p>\n<p>Plus, if you live in a place where it's hot outside at least part of the year, cold breakfast can be nice. At least in the US, the classic cereal + milk breakfast is cold, too, so this can be a nice replacement for that, temp-wise.</p>\n",

The mechanical action will warm the butter slightly and soften it, and the huge increase in surface area will allow the room's ambient warmth to soften the butter much faster. Spread the butter shavings in a single layer to maximize surface area, and they should soften in a few minutes. You'll be unlikely to over-soften the butter with this method, so you won't run a risk of winding up with melted butter instead of softened butter.</p>\n",

Many recipes work better if everything is at room temperature when you mix, so get the eggs you need out of the fridge ahead of time, measure out milk, etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will usually microwave the butter until it accidentally all melts or add in the butter when it's still too hard...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You have to really pay attention when using a microwave to soften butter. Don't walk away. Don't look at your phone. And use the microwave's timer to guard against accidental overheating -- set it for just 10 or 15 seconds or so at a time, depending on how strong your oven is.</p>\n<p>Also, learn from experience. Use short times in the microwave to work up to the degree of softness you want (keeping in mind that the center will soften first). When you succeed in getting the result you want, <em>write down what you did</em> so that it's easy to repeat next time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are some tricks for softening butter quickly?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can soften butter just by working it a bit. Sometimes I skip the microwave and just bash a wrapped stick of butter with a rolling pin, turning it, bashing a bit more, and so on. Maybe <em>bash</em> is too strong a word -- I mean that I'm hitting it hard enough to leave an impression, but not so hard that I worry about breaking the wrapper. That's usually enough to get things going if, for example, I'm going to cream the butter with sugar, in which case the mixer will continue to move the butter around and mix in room-temperature sugar.</p>\n",

It works similarly to some other answers: you will be using your mixer's energy to warm up the butter while working it.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you cut up the butter in thin slices, because a mixer won't be able to break up a stick. It is best to also reduce the other dimensions of the slices - I find that 20x20x3mm (roughly) slices work reasonably well. Also, use a wire whisking attachment, this won't work with a soft creaming paddle. Turn the mixer on high and leave it working for longer than when creaming soft butter - maybe 5 to 10 minutes pre-creaming, then the usual creaming time.</p>\n<p>A food processor will also work, if that's better suited to your recipe. But make sure to process the butter first until soft - so, if you are making e.g. a cracker pie crust, start with the butter only and only add the crackers after it has been softened.</p>\n<p>The caveats:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will end up with creamed butter, which will work for most purposes, even if creaming wasn't specified in the recipe, although there might be some edge cases where it is not desirable.</li>\n<li>The result is usable, but not as good as properly softened butter.

About 12 hours after the first canning, I put the sealed jars back into the canner, and processed them for 90 minutes. I took them out, they were (still?) sealed and seem fine.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m thinking, maybe that could have actually compromised the seal or some other safety aspect? I don\u2019t plan to do that again, but I am wondering if I ruined the broth that I double canned without replacing the lids. I see that the recommendation for reprocessing would be to open them and put new lids on finger tight again. Does anyone have insight on this?  Thanks in advance.</p>\n",

You say they are still sealed, so presumably, yes.</p>\n<h2>If they are popped down, they are sealed, and the seal is, therefore, not compromised.</h2>\n<p>That's the whole reason for &quot;safety lids&quot; that pop down. The old rigid glass tops with rubber seals gave no indication if they were sealed properly, or not. The flexible metal lids <strong>do.</strong></p>\n<p>Removing lids to use new lids is protocol for <strong>failed</strong> seals (not the case here) and repacking (hot) is also required for thick stuff that wasn't sealed or processed properly the first time (also does not apply here.) Your jars were processed as specified, and safe, and then they took an extra trip through the canner, and are still safe.</p>\n<p>My default for anything I've boiled for hours before canning it is to somewhat extend the processing time, since it won't harm the already-boiled-a-long-time product in the jars, and under-processing is actually hazardous, while over-processing is not (though it can spoil the appearance or texture of things that were <strong>not</strong> boiled a long time before going in jars.) I've spent hours making it, so spending (say) 10 minutes more than needed in the canner (just to be sure) has minimal impact on my <em>overall</em> time spent.</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>It is true that the MAIN reason for removing water from potatoes when cooking them is to be able to achieve a crispy, browned (and consider that &quot;browned&quot; usually means &quot;more flavorful&quot;) end product.</p>\n<p>But it is absolutely not the only reason. A secondary reason is cooking time. Oddly, boiling them in water that never passes 212 \u00b0F will take less time than baking in a 350 \u00b0F oven. But given that one is baking them, not boiling, frying, or microwaving them, water is not your friend because so long as they are quite water-filled, and potatoes are something like 80% water, they will be limited to boiling water temperature or less in their cooking mass. And since the water in them is not boiling, and much evaporates, not steams, the temperature of the water pervading them is nowhere near boiling, <em>en masse</em>, as it would in a pot for mashed potatoes.</p>\n<p>Remove enough water and the worm begins to turn. The water in the not-on-top layer can reach higher temperatures and the top layer can lose enough water to crisp and brown up.</p>\n<p>It's a matter of quantity. Over a point, the quantity of water in them simply overwhelms the situation. Go below it and you have more acceptable results. Go below enough and you have great results. WHERE those points are depends upon your exact potatoes, but shouldn't be too important, and your definition of &quot;acceptable&quot; which is entirely up to you. However, the monkey wrench in things is the other foods cooked with them.</p>\n<p>Their cooking times until &quot;acceptable&quot; for all players must be more or less the same. More of the more, and less of the less, so perhaps &quot;essentially the same&quot; is better.</p>\n<p>Squeezing is an old wheeze and not really doable in most peoples' situations. The grating operation should be performed and then multiple &quot;wrap in tea towel, squeeze in a manly way&quot; then let rest and repeat a few times method is the only one that really works. Crushing down in a colander/sieve isn't usually hugely effective as most people don't keep them from moving instead of squeezing, which the tea towel method accomplishes pretty well as a matter of course. On the other hand, a big ball in the tea towel rather than a cylindrical and twisting squeezing operation can be less effective than a well done colander/sieve approach. It's just most people don't have &quot;tea towels&quot; (non-shedding towels one devotes to such things as well as using them as awful potholders). So the colander/sieve approach.</p>\n<p>Whichever of those two though, one needs several stages.</p>\n<p>A microwave can do more than just cook though. Many are familiar with the idea that &quot;waving&quot; an orange or lemon before squeezing gets more juice out of it. Same thing with potatoes. Spread them on a plate, fire up the microwave for, say, a minute, and let them sit afterward with the microwave door open. (Or not... you can wipe it down after, and with the food (potatoes here) not cooling down in the room air, more water can be removed.) You can underlay them on the plate with 5-6 layers of paper towels if you don't use the horrible kind that are a cross between tissue paper and newspaper. &quot;Pillowy&quot; I think would be the word for the right kind. Or on a tea towel!</p>\n<p>If cooling in room air or with the door open, blotting with and leaving on a top layer of paper towels (or a tea towel) will help take away the water.</p>\n<p>Then repeat a time or two or until it doesn't do as much one time. But not enough to cook the potatoes significantly. The cookbook writer probably (&quot;maybe,&quot; in the sense of &quot;60% of the time it works 100% of the time&quot;) tested the recipe and if prepped accordingly it really does bring all the pieces together at the same moment.</p>\n<p>After &quot;waving&quot; them, you can definitely try the squeezing, for the same reason as the orange/lemon, though the release of liquid might not be as much as in them as they were &quot;waved&quot; in a sealed container, not on an open plate (unpeeled, in other words, whilst the potatoes are definitely peeled).</p>\n<p>Either way, squeezing or not, the microwave can be your friend in more ways than just cooking.</p>\n<p>Another approach is to allow them to sit, after some step like the above, in a colander/sieve and drain, then to repeat one's earlier step.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in <code>barbecue</code>'s comment, the heavy weight on them whilst either just wrapped or in a colander/sieve approach can work. It's all a matter of the amount of time one has. More time? A less strenuous approach might be good. Less? Well, more work is required, and when more work is not helpful on its own, assisting it with a microwave expanding the water by heating and driving it out of the food is a way to add &quot;smarter&quot; to the mix.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that removing all the water is not only not possible, but you are going to add wine and cream to ingredients that are not, themselves, unwatery (the peas and cod). The key is to reduce it &quot;enough&quot; and that level will depend solely upon your own circumstances. Your oven's characteristics, those other ingredients particularly the water containing ones, and the potatoes you use themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, all that said, for the potatoes to really crisp up, the loose starch on them needs removed. They need rinsed, and soaked for further rinsing, until the soak water stays mostly clear. THEN they go through the above kinds of approaches.</p>\n<p>More caveats? Well, you never want to crush to the point that you break the potatoes up too much more than however you grated them to start with. Nor do you want to remake your potato with all the crushing. No crushing until they are a new solid and more would make them diamonds. This is part of why you need to do it several times... you want to be closer to &quot;gently crush&quot; than to &quot;wrench them like a stuck wheel lug&quot;... This is also why you don't place them on a couple tea towels and take a rolling pin to them. Paper towels? When I say paper towels, I seriously mean plural. Not the silly one paper towel people put onion rings on to drain. 5-6 of the thicker, pillowy kind is a minimum and if using them as the squeezing medium, then MORE, and probably changed and more squeezing done. They have to take away the water or there is little point to the squeezing. That was why that blotting and leaving to absorb further evaporated water in the &quot;microwave on a plate&quot; suggestion. And why an underlayment of them. Commercials lie like rugs. Paper towels do not soak up gallons of liquid each. (Nor do tea towels (especially as most tea towels are actually cruddy as towels, nothing like terrycloth at all, just useless for drying dishes for instance), so be sure to wring them out too, and &quot;repeat.&quot; Their value is physical strength (no tearing apart when wet!) and absorption mass.)</p>\n<p>Personally, I would not microwave with the goal of cutting off those ten minutes of cooking time as the still quite moist potatoes may end up cooked well at the same time as the other ingredients, but two other things would obtain as well:  the liquids (the water in them at least) you added will not be absorbed into the potatoes as much as they would have been were the potatoes less moist so the &quot;bottom&quot; might be far moister than desired, and the flavors from them more intense, perhaps &quot;sharper&quot; being a better word considering the wine, in the peas and cod, mostly the cod, and less than desired in the potato layer. But then, you might actually prefer that, personally, so something to think on.</p>\n<p>Experimentation is the real solution. The cookbook and websites like this only get you near the goal, unless luck is your specialty. You then have to bring it in to your taste. Or your family's. Unless the recipe ends up near enough to make you happy, of course.</p>\n",

The pirozhki dough consists of: 0.5 kg of flour, 280 ml of water, 38 g of butter (don't ask why is not 40 g), two tablespoons of sunflower oil, 15 g of sugar, one teaspoon of salt, yeast. Some folks add egg(s), I don't; some use other kinds of fat (I say it so that I don't appear to claim I cook some &quot;genuine article&quot; pirozhki, maybe they aren't)</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>Technically yes, it is possible to create a recipe which is preserved by both salt and sugar. But this doesn't mean that you can get any significant reduction in the total amount used (or, controversially, even in the amount of each).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That would avoid the overload of either sugar or salt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, it won't avoid it. You absolutely need such an overload to preserve the food. If you reduce the amounts to the point where you can eat it without it being too much for you, it won't be too much for the bacteria either, and the food won't be preserved.</p>\n<p>Instead, the result would be a food where you get an &quot;overload&quot; of sugar and salt at the same time (which, to me personally, tastes worse than a high amount of either one on its own).</p>\n<p>Remember that sugar is not really a strong preservative, so it always has to be combined with other methods. Simple syrup on its own is not shelf-stable; when you use sugar for preservation, you have to either combine it with drying (=candied fruit) or canning (=jam). So, in typical salt-based methods, you can forget adding a little bit of sugar; it may even make a pickle unsafe by providing more food for bacteria. You would have to achieve a really high concentration of sugar for the whole to work.</p>\n<p>So you could try the opposite, adding some salt to the sugar-based preservation methods. But how are you going to go about it? When candying fruit, what you do is to saturate everything with a sugar syrup, then let the extra liquid evaporate. How do you suggest to reduce the sugar? If you make the syrup more diluted (because you now have the salt), this only means that you would have to wait longer for the extra water to evaporate in the drying phase, after which you will still have the same high concentration of sugar.</p>\n<p>You could make jam with less sugar and add salt, but in fact, you can also make jam with less sugar and not add salt. Basically, what jam requires is a proper acidity level and a proper sterilization procedure, independently of sugar levels, that's why you can can vegetables in water just as well as fruit in syrup. So, by adding salt to jam, the only thing you have gained would be a changed taste, probably for the worse.</p>\n<p>The commenters mentioned a few cases of real-world recipes combining salt and sugar. They were all recipes for cured meat or fish, which is a very different process from your plant-based example. I cannot tell you to what extent both ingredients are contributing to the preservation in these recipes, and to what extent the sugar is there for taste only (they are all salt-and-nitrate driven preservation methods, you cannot preserve meat with sugar alone). If you try them, you will note what I said at the beginning of the answer: they still use a substantial amount of salt and sugar, and the taste is very intense.</p>\n",

But as you didn't preheat the stone when you used it at this low temperature, it probably never even got that hot (BTW you sound like you've learnt this by now, but if you're not going to preheat it, there's no point using a stone).</p>\n<p>So you should probably start by putting it in a cold oven and turning on to 425\u00b0F.

Alternatively it's not unknown to use pizza stones in barbecues, so you could try and burn it off outside, but without the temperature control.</p>\n<p>If there's any chance that water could have soaked in, from even a brief dip or a wipe with a dripping wet cloth, start with a couple of hours not far below boiling point (say 80\u00b0C or 200\u00b0F) to dry it.</p>\n<p>New stones are supposed to be baked with nothing on top before first use anyway.

            "body": "<p>My wife has recently decided not to eat meat, so we have been substituting black beans for ground beef in some of our favorite dishes. This has worked fine so far, but I am not sure about making this substitution in cheeseburger pie. The recipe calls for browned beef with sauteed pepper and onions, tomato sauce, breadcrumbs, and some spices to be baked in a pie shell with a cheese topping. Simple and delicious.</p>\n<p>So far, we have simply done a pound-for-pound replacement of ground beef with beans. But I worry that mashed beans (as we have done in the past for meatball substitutes) will yield a pie that is too dry and dense while un-mashed beans will not be cohesive enough to be served as a pie (like a pie shell filled with bean salad). Should I mash some beans while leaving others whole? Any other suggestions for a vegetarian cheeseburger pie?</p>\n",

                "body": "<p>I often use beans instead of meat, and I think you'd get away with it, but your concerns are certainly valid - it might come out a little dry.  It partly depends on the proportions, especially of the tomato sauce.</p>\n<p>I can offer a few suggestions to tweak your basic recipe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mash the beans (some or all - I'd go for all, knowing that some will be merely broken when others are no longer recognisable as beans) with some suitable liquid.  That could be more sauce, for example, but something including both water and oil is best.</li>\n<li>Increase the amount of onion, softening (some of) it slowly for longer with the lid on, incorporating the resulting tasty liquid into the beans.  Even better is to make caramelised onions - I make big batches in the slow cooker and freeze them.</li>\n<li>Mix a little grated cheese in with the beans - not necessarily a tasty cheese, but one that melts nicely.  This will have a slight binding effect if serving hot, much more if you're planning on allowing it to cool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first two suggestions allow you to adjust the feel of the filling, the last less so as the cheese would melt when you bake the pie - but I do only mean a little cheese.</p>\n<p>Some more ideas, adapting further from your original:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When making bean burgers, I start from dried beans, and slow-cook roughly chopped onion (plus garlic and chillies) in with the beans.  When I drain the beans I reserve the cooking water, and add some back as I roughly puree the beans in a food processor.  That could be a viable option here too.</li>\n<li>When I make a bean chilli, it has sweet potato, pumpkin, or squash in it.  Adding some diced, roasted veg of that sort would be good for the texture.  I suggest quite finely diced, and not a huge amount.</li>\n</ul>\n",

From your question, particularly the last line, it sounds as if you might actually be looking to imitate the flavor and texture of a cheeseburger pie, so you might try something other than beans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>There are sophisticated meat substitutes made by companies such as Beyond and Impossible that are a much closer match to  ground beef in flavor and texture, and can be prepared in much the same way.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Diced mushrooms can have a texture not so dissimilar to ground beef, and they have an umami flavor that is reminiscent of it (or so I am told), more so than beans.

If you use warmer butter, it coats the flour and prevents it from holding as much water and/or as much structure.  The flour temperature wouldn't likely contribute much to the butter's chunkiness.</p>\n<p>Using cold flour will not have a huge effect unless you are doing a no-knead recipe, where the lower temperature could slightly inhibit rising.  Otherwise it will probably warm up by the time you finish mixing the dough.  If it doesn't warm up, then you are baking something colder than the recipe calls for, which means the baking time could be slightly off, which could mean that your baking soda, etc. will take longer to activate.

                "body": "<p>Your question is not entirely clear, so I will answer for both possible options.</p>\n<h2>If you are trying to keep the milk for multiple days in the fridge</h2>\n<p>It will become unsafe after 3-5 days, there is no way around that. If you switch to UHT milk, it will still be unsafe 3-5 days after opening the container, but it won't taste bad, so some people prefer to do it that way.</p>\n<p>So the solution here would be to reduce the amount you are bringing to your work.</p>\n<h2>If you are bringing new milk daily, but the bottle stinks</h2>\n<p>You are probably cleaning the bottle improperly, as the dbmag9's answer and some comments mentioned. Here, you have several options, ordered by my personal preference:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stop using a (typical) bottle.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>As ChrisH said, you can start using a jar, just test first if it leaks when you shake it vigorously. You can specifically search for buying a &quot;leakproof jar&quot; if you find that all random jars you have happen to be leaky.</li>\n<li>Other alternatives would be Weck bottles with a wide mouth and a flat lid held by metal brackets (I don't think they come in single-day-sizes though),</li>\n<li>or a gasketed clip-lid container, there are baby-food-sized ones that hold 200 ml (downside: they aren't convenient for pouring).</li>\n<li>Or get creative and use a baby milk bottle - nowadays, you can get bottles with a sealing cap to exchange the nipple during transport.</li>\n<li>Many people nowadays use an insulated travel mug with a leakproof lid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whichever container you choose, aim for a transparent one, so you can see if it has been washed properly or if it still has a milky layer sticking to it.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Start washing your bottle properly. Many people try to get away with filling the bottle and sloshing it a bit. That never works, especially for fatty contents like milk. You need a spongy brush on a long thin stem, it is sold especially for bottle cleaning (don't use the bristle ones for milk, they are for stuck-on pieces as in fruit juice bottles). You have to stick the brush in and make sure you scrub intensively the whole inner surface with soapy water, and then clean the threads of both bottle and cap. Afterwards, do 3-5 rinses by half-filling it with clean water and sloshing it thoroughly.\nIf you want to use a dishwasher, note that it only works with a wide-mouthed bottle (50 mm or more) and not too tall. Make sure that it stays vertically during the cycle, it is best to stick it on a spike and have other tall-ish items surrounding it.</li>\n<li>As mentioned in comments, single-use bottles can also be used. My environmentalist hairs stand on end when I hear it :( but it would work. It would also be the most expensive solution.</li>\n<li>If you only use tiny amounts of milk daily (e.g. to add to coffee or tea) consider buying single-serving milk or creamer instead, like the ones you get in coffee shops. In Europe, they are available in large supermarkets, and I assume that in Japan, you can at least find them online. Alternatively, there is also powdered creamer available.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It will work pretty much as a freezer, but with a higher temperature.</p>\n<p>So, as a first rule, don't store there anything that won't go in the freezer. Fruit or vegetables that are intended to be consumed fresh, for example, are a no-go, also emulsified products such as dairy substitutes.</p>\n<p>As a second rule, your real freezer will be better at storing food than your special compartment. At its high temperatures, the storage time is only marginally longer than the fridge. So you can't use it to hamster food there.</p>\n<p>You can still find reasons to use this compartment instead of a freezer though. A non-exhaustive list includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>safe long thawing of food from the freezer (e.g. when you are not sure if you will come around to cooking it tomorrow or the day after)</li>\n<li>serving sorbets at the optimal temperature (give them an overnight stay in that compartment to come up to temperature)</li>\n<li>chilling a base for sorbet without the fear that it will freeze on you too quickly</li>\n<li>freezing fruit for smoothies (the harder fruit from the freezer will cause more wear on your blender blades)</li>\n<li>precooking for the week - cook at once and store portions in the compartment. The fridge is too warm for 5+ days, while storing it in the *** freezer means long thawing times, and also there is usually no freezer space free when you need it short-term.</li>\n<li>chilling drinks for serving them very cold. It will be optimal for hard alcohol even with very long storage, and for anything else (beer, soda), it will chill down quicker than in the fridge, but won't run the danger of freezing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will probably come up with more uses over time.

                "body": "<p>The benefit of low temperature cooking (also now known as sous vide, though technically &quot;sous vide&quot; translates as under vacuum), is that you can maintain a low temperature over a long time, both keeping proteins safe, and achieving textural results you can't otherwise.  If you have the old school-type of immersion circulator (the kind that looks like lab equipment), you can probably get away with this.  In the early days of sous vide, some folks were experimenting with cooking directly in oil heated by a circulator.  These days, as @Sneftel points out, most of these devices are designed to work with water only.  Other liquids, or particles of food can really mess things up.  Beyond that, I see a couple of other potential problems.  Floating items means poor heat transfer.  You can account for this by weighing items down, as you suggest, but if you are poaching a whole turkey, for example, if there is an air pocket in the cavity, that could be a potential safety risk, as the heat transfer in the air space will be quite different from the rest of the bird.  Finally, specifically in the case of poultry, dark and white meat are best at different temperatures, so you would have to factor that in.  I do like to cook turkey breast sous vide, then finish in the oven.  So there is merit to your approach.  However, without containing your food, you create some challenges that you need to overcome.</p>\n",

                "body": "<blockquote>\n<p>What is the difference between duram whole wheat flour and hard amber duram wheat</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As with any edible plant, durum wheat comes in different cultivars. &quot;Durum whole wheat flour&quot; is the generic term covering all cultivars. When one brand says &quot;amber&quot;, they are referring to a subgroup of cultivars. It is analogous to saying &quot;apples&quot; and &quot;red apples&quot;. One of the brands seems to have chosen a more &quot;poetic&quot; style in their ingredient list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the word &quot;hard&quot; in the ingredient list is a mystery</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Hard wheat&quot; is just a synonym for &quot;durum wheat&quot;, so saying &quot;hard durum wheat&quot; does not offer any specific information. It must be part of their decision to use fancier descriptions in their ingredient list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why would the one which is not 100% whole wheat have more fiber?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>It doesn't. When you look at the nutrition labels, both have 6 grams of fiber - admittedly, I didn't find a product of either brand claiming 18% DV, but one had 24% and the other 21%, both with an absolute value of 6 g fiber per 56 g pasta. So they are using different DV references, or they made a mistake.</li>\n<li>There is no &quot;the one which is not 100% whole wheat&quot;. Both are 100% whole wheat, see above.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am looking for a pasta that is whole wheat with nothing removed or added just gound up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This can't be guaranteed by labelling. The relevant CFRs are 137.200 and 137.225, and they allow quite a few processing steps for whole (durum) wheat flour. Ascorbic acid and bleaching have to be listed on the label of the flour itself, but I'm unclear whether they have to be mentioned on the label of pasta made from such flour. Added enzymes don't have to be declared, and they can of course process it in other ways, without adding more stuff.</p>\n",

For chicken breast curry, you add the chicken right at the end. Thighs you can simmer for hours, but breast is ruined if over-cooked.</p>\n<p>The spices will never actually 'dissolve' as such; they'll remain solids, but they'll soften so there's no gritty edge left to them, and at the same time impart their flavours through the oil &amp; water.</p>\n<p>You can batch basic curry sauce &amp; keep it in the freezer for months. Then all you need to make your final curry is the chicken.<br />\nYou can freeze finished curries - but not chicken breast. Lamb, beef, chicken thigh will all improve for long-cooking. Chicken breast, if you ensure it's cooked in the sauce, will be over-cooked by the time the curry is cool enough to freeze, then will get another dose of over-cooking as you re-heat it.</p>\n<p>You can even buy ready-prepped onion in the supermarket.</p>\n",

I'd suggest you be careful with this method; if you go too far with adding extra salt and/or acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice), you might end up with something that tastes closer to ketchup than pasta sauce. I'd encourage you to go by taste; separate out a cup or so of the current sauce, taste a bit, think about whether it would taste better if it was saltier or more acidic, then add a small amount of the relevant ingredient, stir, and taste again until satisfied. Once you've got a good handle on whether your particular sauce can be rescued by this method, you can take similar steps with the full batch.</p>\n",

Once it's evaporated it's gone from the liquid anyway, and imagine trying to get a flame from wine - you can't, so it will be at least that strong when the flame goes out (actually quite a bit stronger).</p>\n<p>A reduction might still be the way to go. You'll never get the alcohol content to zero but you'll be diluting it when you add it to the sauce. However I see two problems. The first is that some of the flavours you want will also evaporate, and not evenly, so the flavour profile will change - this might not matter. The second is that adding mainly water (with a little alcohol) could well affect the keeping properties of the sauce, allowing it to spoil quicker.</p>\n<p>In general when I flavour things with tasty spirits, I make a combined reduction and extraction, so for gin I'd add juniper berries and lime zest to the gin as I simmer it very gently. That's not going to be easy with bourbon as the flavour comes from the barrels; I suspect oak chips wouldn't help much.</p>\n",

Bourbon extract is obvious, the liquid smoke is to give you the burnt wood flavor. You could also try vanilla, however many bourbon extracts have a vanilla tinge to begin with so I'd only add this if I couldn't get the flavor combination from the other two.</p>\n<p>I would use a small amount of the Sriracha you want to flavor, and use eye droppers to add trace amounts of each flavoring. liquid smoke is very concentrated, you could even use a cocktail stick to transfer some instead.

                "body": "<p>There are a few good rules of thumb to decide what grain size to choose.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The best recipes will specify what flour type to use. Go with the type required by the recipe. Note that, if a recipe is highly specific in the very exact flour type (and even brand) needed, and you don't have reasons to suspect a purely marketing purpose, it may be not a good choice for your homemade flour. For example, I have a book of gluten-free bread recipes, where the authors explicitly state that rice flour from Asian markets won't work, because it is not sufficiently consistent from batch to batch; with homemade flour, you will get even less consistency.</li>\n<li>You can guess at the type of flour by the recipe's origin. Asian recipes (or recipes for Asian dishes, even if coming from Western authors) are likely to be written for superfine flour, and you also have to pay attention if they specify glutinous or nonglutinous rice. In Germany, the predominant rice flour is &quot;grippy&quot; - it has a larger grain size, but not large enough to be legally classified as semolina - and wholegrain. I have had Italian rice flour in a similar size. In other European countries, it even happens that products labelled as &quot;flour&quot; turn out to be coarse enough to only be usable for gruel, with grains on a millimeter scale. My understanding is that American rice flour is also coarse like in Germany, but frequently white.</li>\n<li>You can also try to guess by the recipe directions. If the recipe directs you to mix the flour with sugar or cold liquid before adding it to other products (especially to something hot, as in puddings or ice cream bases), then it presumes finely milled flour. If you have to sieve the flour, it is likely to be fine. If it has resting times, it is more likely to be written for coarser flour, which benefits from extra time to hydrate properly.</li>\n<li>If your dish is a gluten-free version of something typically made with wheat, it is a good guess to start with the size required for the wheat dish. A pasta can gain a more interesting bite if made with coarser grain size, while a dainty pastry is better made with fine flour.</li>\n<li>There are a few edge cases. Off the top of my head, if you have a cake batter that is more on the liquid side, or if it is very fluffy (e.g. a genoise), don't use coarsely ground flour - it will sink during the baking, building a stodgy layer on the bottom.</li>\n<li>If none of the above applies, use whichever flour gives the effect you prefer. Many dish types will work with both, for example you can make frying batter with any size of flour grains, or even with semolina. Decide what you want, and use that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The suggestions are ordered roughly by order of application - if you can use one that is higher in the list, you don't typically need to worry for those listed further down.</p>\n",

Some go for just getting the outside softened, in which case you would want to start testing after 3-4 minutes of boiling. I prefer to let them get a bit softer to where a fork starts to go in easier, so I wouldn't look before 5 minutes have elapsed.

However, if you are mixing a thick mixture there may be almost no difference in speed or pitch at all.</p>\n<p>A simple way to tell for sure is to run the machine with no attachments. Use a stopwatch and count the number of rotations in a 30 second period on speed 8 and then on speed 10. There will be more rotations on speed 10 than 8 if the mixer is working properly.</p>\n<p>If you aren't getting a speed difference between 8 and 10 then there is some sort of problem with it. A common issue with old mixers is the grease inside breaks down and thickens, there could also be a problem with the motor or the variable resistor which controls the speed. None of those are impossible to fix but it's always a good idea to start with re-greasing.</p>\n",

This process caramelizes the garlic in a fantastically delicious way, and are fantastic on sandwiches, salads, or on bread. They are so delicious, nearly everyone in my family, myself included, enjoys eating entire garlic cloves straight out of the jar.

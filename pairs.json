Ceramic material can sometimes have internal stresses that can be released by sudden shock or changes in temperature. The addition of boiling water could have caused the ceramic to quickly expand and contract, which put significant pressure on the dish causing it to crack.

Yeast feeds on sugar to produce the carbon dioxide gas that causes bread to rise. While the sugar in the milk may be enough to activate the yeast, adding syrup can help produce a more flavorful and moist bread. The syrup can also help create a deeper color for the bread crust and can act as a preservative to keep the bread fresh for longer. However, if you prefer not to use syrup, you can substitute honey or molasses, or omit it altogether and the bread will still rise and bake properly, it may just result in a slightly different taste and texture.</p>"

Bread doughs and pasta doughs, when compared to other doughs, are strong in the sense that they are not crumbly, but very cohesive.</p>\n<p>Within the spectrum of bread dough, a strong dough is a dough that feels like play-doh. Right after kneading, it sticks little or not at all, it is elastic (wants to return to its original shape after deformation), and when it rises, it is capable of trapping lots of gas.</p>\n<p>This is caused by the internal structure of the dough. It is held together by an elastic mesh of a protein called gluten, and when bakers say &quot;strong dough&quot; they mean a dough in which the gluten mesh is stronger than in the weak dough. The mesh is denser and holds together better.</p>\n<p>The way kneading (including stretch and fold) makes dough stronger is by creating gluten. Flour contains the precursors of gluten, glutenin and gliadin; when they meet each other in the presence of water, they stick together. When enough of their molecules stick together, they form the mesh, in which the starch and other dough substances stay embedded. The physical action of the kneading makes these molecules meet each other and stick together, creating the gluten structure.</p>\n<p>The stretch and fold technique is used mostly in very wet bread doughs, where traditional kneading doesn't work well.

Think of the difference between a stack of ten bricks and a stack of ten sheets of plywood. The plywood is thinner. When you stretch and fold and again and again, you move the dough away from the brick paradigm toward a paradigm of thinner walls of gluten (and more of them). Those will then interact with the yeast and produce gas, which is trapped by the gluten walls, producing the magic that is bread. Baguettes or ciabatta with big bubbles in the dough tend to correspond to more stretching-and-folding.</p>\n",

This process is called gluten development and is critical for creating a strong, structured bread dough. However, initially, these strands are not very strong and may not be completely developed.</p>\n<p>Folding the dough helps to align and strengthen these gluten strands, which creates a stronger and more elastic dough. Additionally, folding helps to evenly distribute the yeast and other ingredients throughout the dough. This allows the dough to rise more evenly and develop a better texture.</p>\n<p>When you fold the dough, you essentially stretch it out and then fold it back onto itself. This process helps to create layers of gluten strands, which makes the dough stronger and more structured. Each time you fold the dough, you create more layers, which contributes to the final texture of the bread.</p>\n<p>Overall, folding is an important step in the bread-making process because it helps to create a strong, structured dough that is able to hold its shape during rising and baking.</p>"

It was not wrapped in plastic. Mostly the room is pretty dry, but there was humidity in the summer.</p>\n<p>When I open the bag it is hard like concrete, but breaks apart once I start busting it up and its  light, fluffy once I crush it in my hand. I think there might be a light must scent to it, but its sort of tricky, like is it there or not, seems to disperse after a little while. Color is good.</p>\n<p>I am really interested in any seasoned opinion on this situation. I don't want to make anyone sick, I also don't want to over-react and toss out $100 worth of flour. I am going to test it also for rolls, I should have those in a few days.</p>\n<p>Thanks! I think these responses cover it. I baked some bread to test from the same batch different bag today, Bread was good. I will test run the bag we talked about here in a few days as well as make sure my digestion/energy/flavor don't show any impacts. I broke up the chunks some and put in a giant plastic bag to see if it airs a bit or what. If any aspect of it fails I will make paper mache halloween ghouls. :)</p>\n",

It's very possible that the flour has simply gotten compacted by the weight on top of it rather than from moisture, if the flour is dry it's much more likely to be safe. A year is a long time to store flour, though, so you may be smelling some of the oils in the flour having turned rancid - even if it's safe it may not be good.</p>\n<p>To test for moisture you need an accurate scale and an oven.  You take a decent sized sample, say 100g, spread it out on a tray and bake it for an hour at medium temperature (130C/260F) to drive the moisture out. You weigh it straight after taking it out of the oven and measure the difference. If the water content is above 15% it's been exposed to too much moisture. So if you bake 100g and it comes out at 86g or higher at least you know it's not damp.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to use the flour you'll want to sift it at least once to aerate it and bring back its fluffiness.</p>\n",

If anything seems off or if there are any negative impacts on health, it's best to err on the side of caution and dispose of the flour.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it's up to the individual's discretion whether they decide to use the flour or not.

The wheat bread with yeast is ideally made with several cycles of kneading and rising. A gf bread is not kneaded, just mixed, and then has to rise once. The quickbread is also not kneaded, but it has to be baked immediately, without a rising time. So, if you want to make any of these with a bread machine, you have to use a program that was engineered to deliver the needed conditions.</p>\n<p>If your machine has no gluten-free program, then it is unlikely that any of the other cycles matches the conditions needed for gluten-free bread. There is some likelihood that some of the programs that you have can match some kind of recipe such that the result is not inedibly terrible, but discovering such a combination would require a lot of experimentation, and the result will only be valid for your exact breadmaker model. Also, the result is unlikely to be especially good.</p>\n<p>In the end, if you are making the bread frequently, it may be worth investing in a new breadmaker, after researching which one has a decent gf-program (and then you will have to find out which recipes work - which may or may not use the exact flour mixture you have). If this is a one-off occasion, just buy the bread from a store. GF-bread is very finicky, and probably not worth the learning curve if you won't make it regularly.</p>\n",

        "gpt_answer": "<p>It is possible to bake bread in a bread machine with Swad gluten-free flour. However, since gluten-free flours don't have gluten, which is the protein that gives bread its structure and elasticity, you may need to take some extra steps to get your bread to rise correctly. Here are some tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use the right amount of yeast: Gluten-free bread dough may require more yeast than regular dough to help it rise. You could try using 2-1/4 teaspoons of yeast instead of 2-1/8 teaspoons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add more liquid: Gluten-free flours have a tendency to absorb more liquid than regular flour, so you may need to add more liquid to your dough. Try adding an additional 1/4 cup of warm unsweetened almond milk to your recipe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add some xanthan gum: Xanthan gum is a common ingredient used in gluten-free baking. It is a thickener and stabilizer that can help mimic the texture of gluten. Adding 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum to your recipe may help your bread rise better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let your dough rise twice: Gluten-free bread dough may take longer to rise than regular dough. Try letting your dough rise for at least an hour before baking, then punching it down and letting it rise again for another 30 minutes to an hour.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep an eye on the dough: Gluten-free dough can be more delicate than regular dough, so keep an eye on it during the mixing process. If it looks too wet or too dry, adjust the liquid or flour accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use a gluten-free setting if available: Some bread machines have a gluten-free setting that adjusts the mixing and rising time for gluten-free dough. If your machine has this setting, try using it instead of the quick bread setting.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By making these adjustments, you should be able to make gluten-free bread that rises properly in your bread machine. Good luck with your baking!</p>"

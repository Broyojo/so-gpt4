Right after kneading, it sticks little or not at all, it is elastic (wants to return to its original shape after deformation), and when it rises, it is capable of trapping lots of gas.</p>\n<p>This is caused by the internal structure of the dough. It is held together by an elastic mesh of a protein called gluten, and when bakers say &quot;strong dough&quot; they mean a dough in which the gluten mesh is stronger than in the weak dough. The mesh is denser and holds together better.</p>\n<p>The way kneading (including stretch and fold) makes dough stronger is by creating gluten. Flour contains the precursors of gluten, glutenin and gliadin; when they meet each other in the presence of water, they stick together. When enough of their molecules stick together, they form the mesh, in which the starch and other dough substances stay embedded. The physical action of the kneading makes these molecules meet each other and stick together, creating the gluten structure.</p>\n<p>The stretch and fold technique is used mostly in very wet bread doughs, where traditional kneading doesn't work well.

You take a decent sized sample, say 100g, spread it out on a tray and bake it for an hour at medium temperature (130C/260F) to drive the moisture out. You weigh it straight after taking it out of the oven and measure the difference. If the water content is above 15% it's been exposed to too much moisture. So if you bake 100g and it comes out at 86g or higher at least you know it's not damp.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to use the flour you'll want to sift it at least once to aerate it and bring back its fluffiness.</p>\n", "title": null, "tags": null, "answer_count": null, "comment_count": 0, "favorite_count": null}, {"id": "121977", "post_type_id": 2, "score": 17, "accepted_answer_id": null, "parent_id": "121971", "creation_date": "2022-10-15T15:33:28.417000", "view_count": null, "body": "<p>From your description it sounds more like the flour was simply packed tightly rather than getting damp, but even if it remained dry, I think you will likely find the flavor is off.</p>\n<p>You said you don't want to throw away $100 worth of flour, but ask yourself if you would pay $100 for a 50 lb bag of flour that you knew was a year old?</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a way to repurpose the flour rather than just discarding it, you could always use it to make salt dough for crafting, or donate it to a school for this purpose.</p>\n", "title": null, "tags": null, "answer_count": null, "comment_count": 0, "favorite_count": null}, {"id": "121978", "post_type_id": 2, "score": 5, "accepted_answer_id": null, "parent_id": "121971", "creation_date": "2022-10-15T18:34:13.620000", "view_count": null, "body": "<p>Simple: taste it.</p>\n<p>Stale flour tastes notably bad, even in its raw state.

Below are some possible reasons why your sourdough didn't rise overnight:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Your starter may not be mature enough: starter that is weak or new may not have enough leavening power to raise the bread. Consider feeding your starter a few times more before using it to make bread.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your starter may not be active enough: make sure your starter is active and bubbly before using it. If it's not, it may not be strong enough to raise your bread.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The temperature may be too low: yeast activity slows down at low temperatures, so if your kitchen is cold, you may need to give your dough more time to rise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not enough time given to the dough to rise: depending on the strength of your starter and the temperature of your dough, it may take longer than overnight for your dough to rise. You can try giving it more time before baking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dough hydration: The dough may be too dry, which would make it difficult to catch air and rise. You may need to add more water to the dough, depending on what flour you're using.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's generally not recommended to mix regular yeast with sourdough, as this will affect the flavor of your bread. If your sourdough has not risen properly overnight, you can try giving it more time and keeping in a warm place, about 70-80\u00b0F or 21-26\u00b0C, until it has risen. If it still doesn't rise, you may need to start over with a fresh starter or adjust your recipe.</p>"}}
